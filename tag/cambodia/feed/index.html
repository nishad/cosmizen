				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wraith of global meltdown is still resonating in some form or the other in most outsourcing dependent countries. The recent Cambodia garment workers’ strike turns out to be a perfect case in point to the premise.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Cambodian police with riot gears thwarted a week-long strike sparked off by the suspension of a union official at a Malaysian-owned garment factory, which produced goods for international brands including Gap, Benetton, Adidas and Puma. It has been reported that the clashes between more than 100 armed police force and 3,000 garment workers in Phnom Penh had resulted in nine women being hurt, though authorities maintain the operations did not hurt anyone.</p>
<p>The BBC&#8217;s Guy De Launey in Phnom Penh says the unrest could be a symptom of a wider social malaise owing to dwindling orders in Cambodia&#8217;s crucial garment industry which resulted in tens of thousands of job losses. Early this month, government increased the minimum wage from about $50 to $60, but the double-digit inflation and the trade unions demands of above $80 seemed to be bogging down the effect.</p>
<p>Albeit the unions retracted from a three-day general strike in protest against the meagre rise, the union official’s suspension is believed to have aggravated the situation. But last week’s Huffington Post report interpreted these strikes as a knee-jerk reaction to irrational calibration of wages by the outsourcing firms or associated agencies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in last week’s blog by Auret van Heerden, President and CEO of the Fair Labour Association visualizes firms that build strong Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes into their operations and culture would have the edge in many markets. Nevertheless, evidences show such practices by firms are beyond procurement principles as it solely reckons pricing and related aspects devoid of labour rights &#8211; especially post-meltdown.</p>
<p>Cambodia’s textile industry accounts for around 85 percent of exports, and is the country’s third-largest source of income after tourism and agriculture. The Southeast Asian state continues to be in the grip of labour problems particularly after the global economic crisis that bombed exports severely to create an economic landscape of joblessness &#8211; and desertion of production units by the employers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cambodia&#8217;s World Bank country manager Qimiao Fan on Tuesday said that  Cambodia’s financial and banking regulations have assisted the country  to sustain during the tumultuous times of global economic uncertainties.  While addressing the workshop on corporate governance, the World Bank  official said the success of Cambodia&#8217;s finance industry was proof that  improving corporate governance worked.</p>
<p>Qimiao apprised Cambodia&#8217;s  financial and banking methodology has particularly helped many of  Cambodia&#8217;s commercial banks and micro-finance institutions to raise  their standards of corporate governance, which eventually got rewarded  with greater investments. Likewise, Chea Chanto, governor of the  National Bank of Cambodia opined the recent bad experience of the world  financial crisis taught Cambodia the hard way about how the failure of  bank and financial system could impact livelihoods.</p>
<p>Chanto also  told that Cambodia has learned a lot from the Asian financial crisis,  and the National Bank of Cambodia has taken a series of measures to  better supervise and regulate the banking and financial system in the  country. Banks have an overwhelmingly dominant position in the country&#8217;s  financial system, representing more than 90 percent and are extremely  important engines of economic growth, he added.</p>
<p>In contrast, it  should be recalled that Qimiao had said in the recently concluded  Cambodia Development Cooperation Forum (CDCF) &#8220;transparency and  accountability in the management of public finances and natural  resources&#8221; were critical issues. This reference was in line with the  international watchdog organization, Global Witness, which slammed  donors last week for continuing to hand over huge sums of aid money,  despite evidence of widespread corruption and mismanagement of public  funds. Overseas donors continued to pledge financial support on the  controversial Land Management and Administration Project, or LMAP that  supposed to have rendered many homeless.</p>
