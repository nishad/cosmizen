				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Serbian businesspeople feel that though their country has opened  doors to the Croatian firms and products since 2000, the Serbian  companies are still not welcome in Croatia. According to a story  appeared in the Politika, a Belgrade daily and the oldest newspaper in  the Balkans, a Serbian fruit juice company owner is reported to have  observed that there were many obstacles for the Serbian businesses to be  successful in Croatia.</p>
<p>Slobodan Radun, the owner of Nectar, the  leading Serbian juice and soft drinks producer, told &#8220;Their (Croatian)  products have solid treatment here, their companies are buying ours, and  we do not have access to their market. We offer products of top quality  for lower prices than their producers, but it&#8217;s not working. Sometimes a  company with a special connection can do it, but it’s generally  impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Politika opined that though the government  agencies claimed the economic relations had improved, &#8220;not even the  contemporary trends and sacred international rules of market economy –  the free flow of goods and capital – are being respected&#8221;</p>
<p>According  to the data from the Croatian National Bank, the Croatian companies  invested in $641.7mn by the end of last year in Serbia, making Serbia  the second largest destination for the Croatian foreign investments. The  bilateral trade between both sides has increased manifold from $40mn in  2000 to $1bn in 2009. In the past seven years the trade has gone  against Serbia registering a trade deficit of $716.6mn, and Serbia is  one of the rare European countries with which Croatia has trade surplus.</p>
<p>It  should be noted that, in a recent conference, Economy Ministry State  Secretary Nebojsa Ciric admitted that only one Serbian investment was  able to succeed in Croatia, when the Swisslion Takovo bought the  Croatian Euro Food Market but otherwise most efforts bombed. It is yet  to be seen whether the last month’s accord between both nations to  remove political bottlenecks and simplifying business processes would  translate into equilibrized economic co-operation.</p>
