				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Turkish government through various trade programs is ensuring that  its economy will grow by more than 12 percent in the coming quarters.  The one such program is the &#8220;Turkey-World Trade Bridge 2010 (TWTB) meet&#8221;  conducted by the Confederation of Businessmen and Industrialists of  Turkey (TUSKON), a Turkish business organization.</p>
<p>Last week,  Mehmet Simsek, Finance Minister of Turkey told that his country&#8217;s GDP  would grow 12 percent in the first quarter of 2010. He had claimed that  the economy was recovering quickly from the backlash of the global  meltdown in view of country&#8217;s several internal crisis management  programs.</p>
<p>The 2nd TWTB meet, which is expected to become a venue  for 7bn of trade deals, is held between 14th and 20th June. According to  sources, the meet has been able to attract nearly 2,200 businessmen  from 135 countries and 1,200 Turkish traders as well. About 1,600  translators are interpreting the forums into 38 languages, and the  participants would form delegations to visit 62 provinces of Turkey.</p>
<p>The  primary objective of the meet would be to include and optimize small  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) of Turkey to tide over the  challenges from the monopolistic-oriented economies. Moreover, Turkey  has no intention to endlessly wait for the EU membership to shape its  economy to usher in growth particularly at a time when Europe is facing a  volatile economic climate.</p>
<p>Through the TUSKON, a confederation  with a strong base in Turkey and abroad, the country will be assisting  entrepreneurs to overcome the language barrier by providing language  courses, and in some cases even translations. The Turkish business  confederation along with its affiliations across the world would be  working together by simplifying and expediting business processes for  country&#8217;s SMEs to make the export engine move forward rapidly.</p>
<p>The  TUSKON has sister organizations in 135 countries across the world, and  these institutions are set up by the Turkish entrepreneurs and  volunteers to integrate its members to the international business  environment. The Indo-Turkish Business Association, Thai-Turkish  Business Association, South Africa Turkish Business Association and the  Turkish and Cameroon Business Association are some of the business  organizations affiliated to the parent confederation.</p>
<p>Turkey as  an emerging export-oriented economy is paying vital importance for the  TWTB meet as its trading history indicates those Turkish international  business entities monetized significantly better than the domestic ones.  A number of government agencies and companies including the Foreign  Ministry, the Turkish Exporters Assembly (TIM), Turkish Airlines (THY)  and Bank Asya are joining force with the TUSKON to make the meet  successful.</p>
