				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the Gem &amp; Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC),  India&#8217;s polished diamond exports rose 73 percent year on year to almost  $1.8bn in May and the polished imports rose 68 percent during the same  period to $984mn for the month. The rough imports were up 55 percent in  May to $978mn; similarly, the rough exports rose 56 percent year over  year to $78mn, giving India net rough imports of $900mn, up from the  $541mn it posted in May 2009.</p>
<p>The available figures indicate that  the Indian diamond industry along with other major diamond trading  nations is gradually recovering from the shattering effects of global  economic crisis. Though the country was able to make some progress on  export front in the month of May, it is still significantly short of the  2008 level of $2.55bn in the same month on polished diamond exports.  Besides, India still has a polished export deficit of $864mn for the  first five months of 2010, up from the deficit of $430mn it posted a  year ago.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear whether India will be able to  put the past trade record on track as major procurement sources have  become susceptible to stiff competition. The latest developments in  Zimbabwe and China ties signal that the latter is making inroads in  obtaining diamond mining rights from some African countries including  the former, to nudge India from the African procurement zone.</p>
<p>China  is planning to augment its diamond polishing sector, which only  produced $3bn in exports in 2009 as compared to India&#8217;s $17.5bn. It  seems a fight is brewing between the world&#8217;s two fastest growing  economies, China and India, to lay claim over diamonds of Africa.</p>
<p>According  to sources, a deal has been struck between Zimbabwe and the Chinese  government to supply weapons in exchange for a steady supply of  diamonds. Moreover, some reports claim that Zimbabwe’s government is  secretly giving mining permits to soldiers of the Chinese military,  challenging the Kimberly Process, which promotes the mining and  production of conflict-free diamonds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-day meet by the Kimberley Process member states is in progress since Tuesday to review and fix illegal trade practices involved in the diamond mining and trade globally. The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is a rough diamond certification created by more than 75 diamond producing nations to arrest and prevent the trade in conflict/blood diamonds that led to the death and displacement of millions of people across the globe notably from African countries.</p>
<p>The illegally mined diamonds get its name conflict/blood diamonds after the rebel or government forces employed inhuman methods by enslaving the common population to mine these precious gems. The KPCS is currently chaired by Namibia, and was established in 2003 which also serves as a deterrent to blood diamonds getting into global market.</p>
<p>As per KPCS norms, the rough diamonds must be sealed in tamper-resistant containers and required to have forgery-resistant, conflict-free certificates with unique serial numbers each time they cross an international border. But the Namibian Deputy Minister of Mines, Bernhard Esau during his opening speech in the meet admitted that fake Kimberley Process certificates were a growing concern and had to find ways to stop them.</p>
<p>Taking into account several blatant violations on human rights and illegal trade practices in countries including Zimbabwe, Lebanon, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Venezuela despite KPCS being in effect, a coalition of civil society groups stated that KPCS was failing to achieve its primary goal. Similarly, Global Witness which exposes the corrupt exploitation of natural resources and international trade systems said “The clock is running out on Kimberley Process credibility”.</p>
<p>In October last year, Zimbabwe government forcefully took charge of the Marange fields, the high diamond yielding region on the pretext of widespread illegal mining. As a result, the World Federation of Diamond Bourses in April banned the sale of diamonds from the Marange fields. Yet illegal trade of blood diamond from Zimbabwe is still rampant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Venezuela despite agreeing in 2008 that it would suspend its diamond trade until new control systems could be established, a civil society investigative visit to Venezuela in May this year found that diamonds are still being mined and smuggled into the global legitimate market with complete impunity. With such glaring examples at hand, KPCS had to put in place some tough measures to curb blood/conflict diamonds being traded in any market.</p>
