				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cambodia&#8217;s World Bank country manager Qimiao Fan on Tuesday said that  Cambodia’s financial and banking regulations have assisted the country  to sustain during the tumultuous times of global economic uncertainties.  While addressing the workshop on corporate governance, the World Bank  official said the success of Cambodia&#8217;s finance industry was proof that  improving corporate governance worked.</p>
<p>Qimiao apprised Cambodia&#8217;s  financial and banking methodology has particularly helped many of  Cambodia&#8217;s commercial banks and micro-finance institutions to raise  their standards of corporate governance, which eventually got rewarded  with greater investments. Likewise, Chea Chanto, governor of the  National Bank of Cambodia opined the recent bad experience of the world  financial crisis taught Cambodia the hard way about how the failure of  bank and financial system could impact livelihoods.</p>
<p>Chanto also  told that Cambodia has learned a lot from the Asian financial crisis,  and the National Bank of Cambodia has taken a series of measures to  better supervise and regulate the banking and financial system in the  country. Banks have an overwhelmingly dominant position in the country&#8217;s  financial system, representing more than 90 percent and are extremely  important engines of economic growth, he added.</p>
<p>In contrast, it  should be recalled that Qimiao had said in the recently concluded  Cambodia Development Cooperation Forum (CDCF) &#8220;transparency and  accountability in the management of public finances and natural  resources&#8221; were critical issues. This reference was in line with the  international watchdog organization, Global Witness, which slammed  donors last week for continuing to hand over huge sums of aid money,  despite evidence of widespread corruption and mismanagement of public  funds. Overseas donors continued to pledge financial support on the  controversial Land Management and Administration Project, or LMAP that  supposed to have rendered many homeless.</p>
