				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent UN report, the World Oceans Day June 8 designated  and celebrated by the UN since last year would be a fishless one in 2050  if the fishing industry failed to restructure itself. The United  Nations Environment Program report says earnest streamlining of fishing  industry is required to protect the marine life before the oceans are  completely disembowelled.</p>
<p>The report recommends reducing the  number of large industrial fishing vessels and redirecting  counter-productive subsidies. It identifies human activities has dire  effect on the world&#8217;s oceans and seas.</p>
<p>The vulnerable marine  ecosystems, such as corals, and important fisheries are being damaged by  over-exploitation, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing,  destructive fishing practices, invasive alien species and marine  pollution, especially from land-based sources.  Besides, increased sea  temperatures, sea-level rise and ocean acidification caused by climate  change also pose a greater threat to marine life which will eventually  impact the lives of coastal and island communities and economies.</p>
<p>It  is estimated that 11 to 26mn tons of fish or one-fifth of the global  reported catch annually fall under the category of illegal, unreported  and unregulated fishing. Similarly, only about 25 percent of commercial  stocks are in a healthy or even reasonably healthy state. Some 30  percent of fish stocks are considered collapsed and 90 percent of large  predatory fish like the blue fin tuna, so prized by sushi aficionados  have almost disappeared since the middle of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Nonetheless,  the five-day conference on fish conservation opened at the UN  Headquarters in New York on Monday gives hope on taking stern measures  to contain all kinds of man-made oceanic hazards. The review is held  every four years to address the declining numbers of fish stocks under  the UN agreement, which took effect from 2001.</p>
<p>The conference is  reviewing implementation of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement that  establishes a legal regime for long-term conservation and sustainable  use of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. It will provide an  opportunity for countries to consider new measures to tighten  implementation of the legal regime.</p>
<p>The day one of the conference  witnessed the UN Ambassador for the tiny Pacific nation of Palau,  Stuart Beck, condemning the killing of 73mn sharks a year, for shark fin  soup alone. &#8220;The slaughter of sharks for their fins to make soup is as  needless and cruel as the killing of elephants for their tusks to make  ornaments,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sharks are susceptible to overfishing  because of their low fertility rates and long life spans. But shark  fishing has boomed since the 1980s triggered by demand from China and  other nations for shark fin soup, a prized symbol of wealth.</p>
<p>The  global seafood consumption has doubled over the past 40 years with many  switching to seafood diet as it was found healthier than other meat  products. With the UN estimation of about 20mn boats with  fishing capacity of 1.8 to 2.8 times larger than the oceans can  sustainably support, the industry leaders as well as governments may  have to make grave compromises on ocean management to see a sustainable  ocean in the coming decades. The UN lists the top 10 nations with the  biggest fisheries hauls as China, Peru, the US, Indonesia, Japan, Chile,  India, Russia, Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
