				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a study, what the world is hearing from the H1N1 space about the false pandemic alarm and the WHO staff’s collusion with pharma powerhouse are just what happened in the 1990’s at the behest of a tobacco giant in evolving the European policies. Academics at the University of Bath and University of Edinburgh claim they have proof that a cigarette giant in the mid-1990s connived with the European Policy Centre (EPC), the prominent Brussels think-tank, to create a front group to ensure that the EU framework for evaluating policy options emphasized business interests at the expense of public health.</p>
<p>According to the study, the BAT constructed a policy network of a series of major corporations, including SmithKline Beecham, Shell, Zeneca, Tesco, Bayer and Unilever, to mount a multi-year lobby campaign in shaping the EU&#8217;s impact assessment system. Interestingly, the study features one of the firms, SmithKline Beecham now GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) which is in the limelight for alleged kickbacks to a WHO staff to snowball H1N1into a high level pandemic call.</p>
<p>The study was funded by the Smoke-Free Partnership and Cancer Research UK, and is published in the Public Library of Science Medicine journal. Surprisingly, the study indicates that similar business strategies are still possible today for big businesses to manipulate several world body decisions including that of the WHO’s.</p>
<p>In December, it was reported that a Finnish member of the WHO board, an advisor on vaccines, had received €6mn for his research centre from the vaccine manufactures, GSK. According to documents acquired through the Danish ‘Freedom of Information Act,’ Professor Juhani Eskola’s Finnish institute, THL, received almost €6.3mn from GSK for research on vaccines during 2009.</p>
<p>As a result, Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, Chairman of Council of Europe Health Committee has initiated a probe into the alleged scam in a bid to investigate the swine flu scare exaggeration. Wodarg in a recent TV interview to Russia Today (RT) concluded that the labeling of H1N1 as a pandemic was a false alarm…and it was costly and hurt a lot of people unnecessarily.</p>
<p>It is feared that the false alarm which triggered vaccination spree could possibly spark off side effects or causal illnesses among the vaccinated. In response to RT’s query whether there would be growing number of law suits against pharma firms involved in the vaccine manufacturing, Wodarg said that actions could vary from country to country. In another recent analysis from Harvard University, suggests that the swine flu “pandemic” has been oversold, and the US government has taken unnecessary steps, including mass vaccinations.</p>
<p>While juxtaposing the two events, the H1N1 virus could be even a lab release for business purpose as it is alleged in the e-security business solutions that consumers are frightened by false alarms that a dangerous virus was on the prowl, which eventually compels them to go in for anti-virus to protect their e-ware.</p>
<p>In the backdrop of the new study, the law suits and claimants would be astronomically high in H1N1 case as compared to tobacco cases since it was government recommended program to get vaccinated in many countries. Therefore, the alleged perpetrators of H1N1 should be geared up to spend the money they have earned through illegal means to either buy up the law courts or reimburse.</p>
