				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Union President Herman Van Rompuy has made a whirlwind trip  to the Western Balkan states starting from Slovenia through Croatia,  Serbia and Kosovo to demonstrate the Union&#8217;s commitment for expansion.  The EU head&#8217;s visit to the countries that emerged after the sanguinary  break-up of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and Albania is  interpreted as EUâ€™s special interest on the region in trying times.  Rompuy said on Monday &#8220;The Western Balkans region is a key priority for  EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Rompuy visited Croatia, he told that the country would  become the second state from the region to enter the EU after  Slovenia&#8217;s inclusion in 2004. Croatia&#8217;s entry to the EU seemed to be  likely soon as indicated in the words of the president, he said,  &#8220;Croatia&#8217;s joining the EU will give a positive signal to the region by  proving that the accession to the EU is attainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidentally,  Croatia&#8217;s EU accession negotiations started five years ago, and only  after Rompuy assumed office in December 2009 they gained some steam.  However, the Daily Delo, a leading Slovenian newspaper has questioned  the president&#8217;s earnestness of the integration of the region to the EU  zone.</p>
<p>On the contrary, while Rompuy visited Belgrade the Serbian  President Boris Tadic expressed dissatisfaction with the decelerated  process of the EU integration as he felt it was crucial for the future  of the West Balkans. The Serbian business community has often complained  about the problems they faced without the ticket to the EU despite they  produced low cost quality goods.</p>
<p>Rompuy reiterated that progress  in European integration primarily depended on each candidate&#8217;s own  merit and performance. Nonetheless, it has to be seen whether the merit  mantra would alone work as an expansion model to the EU as it may also  rely on solving the ongoing financial crisis which quaked the EU after  showing signs of recovery from the global meltdown.</p>
