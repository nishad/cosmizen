				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a press meet in Amman, Mohammad Twaijri, assistant secretary general of the Arab League for Economic Affairs stated that Jordan had been chosen to head a technical committee to prepare the road map of integrating inter-Arab trade. He was speaking to the press after the conclusion of a one-day consultative meeting of transport ministers and representatives from 12 Arab countries in linking the Arab world through comprehensive transportation plans.</p>
<p>Transport Minister of Jordan, Sahel Majali said the consensus among the representatives and ministers in selecting Jordan for such a project was a big leap before making concrete moves towards inter-Arab co-operation in the transportation sector. All the 22 nations of the Arab League spread across the Gulf and African region is expected to take part in the Arab transportation and related projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of the proposal, we have discussed several issues, including custom procedures between Arab countries, visa and movement of people, goods and services, in addition to the establishment of a railway network to connect regional markets,&#8221; Majali stated while addressing the joint press meet along with Twaijri. Majali said that he was confident of achieving the ambitious goal particularly because of the determination demonstrated by ministers in overcoming any obstacles.</p>
<p>Twaijri informed that the feasibility report on integration of Arab transportation should be submitted to the Arab leaders by 2011. A proposal to this regard was prepared by the Jordanian government and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (UN-ESCWA).</p>
<p>After the meeting, the ministers and representatives had an audience with the Prime Minister of Jordan, Nader Dahabi to apprise him about the developments. Dahabi pledged support and cooperation for the project, and promised that he would work in removing all roadblocks towards this end.</p>
