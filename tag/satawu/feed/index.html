				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Africa (SA) continues to reel under the &#8216;strike&#8217; bogey with  transport strike nearing end while others surfacing.  A likely strike by  half of the workers at state-owned power utility Eskom and another by  civil servants, including nurses, police and teachers, is looming large  at SA, the first African country to host the soccer World Cup.</p>
<p>SA&#8217;s  present crisis besides damaging trade with Europe and Asia, it also  corroborates the criticism by some European countries in regards to the  preparedness of the country to host such a mega event like the World Cup  come June and July. The SA Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and  Forestry Tina Joemat-Pettersson told reporters losses to the industries  under her ministry are estimated over 1bn rand ($127mn).</p>
<p>The  strike, well over a fortnight has already brought the exim trade of the  country to a standstill inflicting potential losses to the job market  and international trade contracts. Items like metals, cars, fruits and  wine to Europe and Asia, as well as imports of automotive parts and fuel  supplies is reported to have affected. FIFA, the football governing  body has informed imports of some equipment for the event has also been  impacted.</p>
<p>Though it was predicted before the strike the coal and  iron ore exports and fuel supplies could be stalled, stocks and supply  process as so far avoided such a situation. Likewise, the domestic power  supplies also have not been affected much by the strike since coal for  the power plants is largely supplied through conveyor belts directly  from the mines.</p>
<p>The workers of the SA logistics group Transnet  which has about 54000 trade union members began strike demanding 15  percent pay hike despite the group conceding 11 percent. Although over  60 percent have returned to work since Monday, the smaller South African  Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) has decided to go ahead  with its demand.</p>
