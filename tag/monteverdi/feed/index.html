				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A multitude of Italian farmers converged on the Austrian border to  protest at the importation of tainted cheese from Germany with  Italian-sounding brand names. The demonstration was held on account of  last month’s seizure of a consignment of 70,000 German mozzarella cheese  balls that turned blue once they were removed from their packages or  exposed to air.</p>
<p>The cheese which was made in Germany, by the firm  Milchwerk Jager Gmbh &amp; Co has been blamed for exporting  sub-standard versions by mimicking Italian sounding brand names such as  Fattorie Torresina, Lovilio and Monteverdi. Although the mozzarella was  marked as made in Germany and did not receive any complaints of illness  linked to the ‘blue’ mozzarella at that time, the farmers regard the  incident has harmed the reputation of Italy as a quality food-maker.</p>
<p>Preliminary  analyses at Turin&#8217;s Zooprofilattico (veterinary preventative medicine)  Institute analyses showed it to be bacterial rather than toxic  contamination. Besides bacteria, the blue colouring could also indicate  elements of copper, nickel or lead in the milk or the aqueous solution  used to preserve the cheese.</p>
<p>During the protest, Italy&#8217;s main  farm lobby Coldiretti argued that the citizens had the right to know  what they were buying and origin of those products. Similarly,  Agriculture Minister of Italy Giancarlo Galan told that he would press  for new legislation requiring milk producers to give more details about  the provenance of their milk and related products.</p>
<p>Mozzarella is  the most favourite variety of cheese in Italy, and about 60 percent of  Italians consume 164mn kilograms (360mn pounds) per annum. With this  German trade infringement, Italian cheese producers feel the original  mozzarellas may lose their brand value among the consumers. Tuesday&#8217;s  protest saw border police inspecting trucks bringing milk, meat and  other products into Italy.</p>
