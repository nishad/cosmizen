				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Serbian President Boris Tadic’s trip to China which began on last Wednesday has culminated in the signing of a strategic partnership deal between both countries. During his visit he discussed political and bilateral trade interest with the Chinese President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and China&#8217;s top legislator Wu Bangguo.</p>
<p>Hu admitted the closer ties with Serbia was of paramount importance, and progressed well regardless of unpleasant developments across the globe. The talks between the two have also covered the contentious Taiwan and Kosovo issues. Both reaffirmed their respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other&#8217;s nation.</p>
<p>At a business forum organized by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), Tadic said he was looking at improving high-level political links to help find ways to increase investment in his country. Earlier, Hu had recommended a four-point agenda to forge better ties with Serbia which included constant high level exchanges, co-operation in the field of trade and commerce, holding of socio-cultural activities and multilateral cooperation in international fora.</p>
<p>China-Serbia trade was valued at $125mn in the first five months of this year, down 33.1 percent year on year amid the global economic downturn. However, China-Serbia trade volume surged from $9mn in 1994 to $460mn last year, said Dong Songgen, vice chairman of the CCPIT.</p>
<p>The Serbian delegation which also included Economy Minister Mladan Dinkic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic felt the tour was very successful. The trade co-operation with China is expected to give further boost to the Serbian economy as it already enjoys FTAs with the EU, Russia, Belarus, Turkey and the eight countries of South Eastern Europe (SEE), giving Serbia access to a free trade market covering 800mn people.</p>
