				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysia Airlines (MAS) in collaboration with SITA, an air transport  technology major, has installed iPad kiosks at the Kuala Lumpur Sentral  (KL Sentral), to simplify flyers’ travelling needs. The initial five  MHkiosks named after MHMobile stationed at KL Sentral, which serves  about 900 customers a day, can now book and purchase flight tickets,  search for schedules and status, check-in as well as choose seat via the  kiosk.</p>
<p>MHmobile is an optimized user interface that enables  travellers to book flights and access up to date travel information  while on the move. In a world&#8217;s first, MHkiosk employs touch-screen  technology, and is equipped with passport and card readers for instant  passenger recognition, and print 2D barcode boarding passes.</p>
<p>The  introduction of the MHkiosk follows Jetstar&#8217;s recent debut as the first  airline to use iPads as in-flight entertainment on their aircrafts.  Jetstar Airways is a low-cost subsidiary of Qantas, the national airline  of Australia.</p>
<p>MD/CEO of the MAS, Tengku Datuk Azmil Zahruddin  claimed that there was huge interest in the iPad MHkiosks as it was so  simple and user-friendly; and he later added that the MAS had plans of  introducing more such kiosks depending up on the success. As part of the  promotion, the customers using the newly launched kiosks will get a  waiver on the administrative fee for travel during the six-month pilot  project period.</p>
<p>The kiosks is understood to eliminate admin  charges since the ticketing process is electronically managed allowing  the customers to select their itineraries, credit card payments,  confirmation via SMS and email sans printing material. &#8220;It will mean  better queue management at our ticket offices during peak hours when  customers can be re-directed to &#8216;stand-alone&#8217; iPad MHkiosks,&#8221; said  Zahruddin.</p>
