				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A delegation led by Thai Trade Commissioner Kiat Sittheeamom which comprised representatives from a cross-section of business firms from Thailand presented its interest in exploring varied sectors of Bahrain economy to Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa during its visit to Bahrain recently. The Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander, Salman welcomed Thailandâ€™s decision to invest in his country in a big way, and informed that Bahraini-Thai relations was in line with King Hamad&#8217;s road map of creating a win-win ambience for peoples of both nations.</p>
<p>Head of the Crown Prince&#8217;s Court Shaikh Khalifa bin Duaij Al Khalifa and Dr Hassan Fakhro Industry and Commerce Minister attended the meeting at Riffa Palace. The Thai team exchanged views with Bahraini counterparts on the proposed investment projects in Bahrain in joint ventures.</p>
<p>The Prince told that his country was focussed on freedom of competition and commitment to transparency as key aspects to achieve success. He inquired about the Thai expertise in promoting pisciculture and ways to boost Bahrain&#8217;s fish reserves. He felt if Thailand could employ its fish farming techniques in Bahrain, the country would be able to become the best in the region.</p>
<p>During the meet, both parties are understood to have discussed the possibilities of promoting Bahrain as one of the food trade platforms of the Middle East. The Thai delegation which had representatives from aluminium and mining industries is believed to have worked out on the modalities of respective trade potentials.</p>
<p>While addressing the delegation, Salman also underscored the need for housing and development projects as they could meet the immediate demands of the citizens of Bahrain in the related segment.
