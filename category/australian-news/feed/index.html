				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The dolphin trading by one of the Solomon Islands&#8217; exporter has not gone well with a leading animal right organization. Solomons dolphin activist Lawrence Makili who is the Earth Island Institute&#8217;s Pacific Regional Director has told AAP that despite the institute&#8217;s tireless efforts to end the live trade, one dolphin dealer had retarded the momentum.</p>
<p>But Francis Chow, a local businessman who is blamed for restraining and stressing out eight dolphins in a tiny shallow pool for six months informed that his park was neither killing nor breaking any laws on dolphin trade rather exporting them to marine parks in Australia or the US. In response to the protest, Chow said the hypocrite protestors should stop driving Japanese cars, and should harass the Japanese whalers.</p>
<p>However, Chow seemed to be unaware of the fact the people behind the protest played a part to delay Japanese dolphin or whaling hunt last season. Renowned dolphin activist and member of Earth Island Institute&#8217;s Marine Mammal Team Ric O&#8217;Barry along with his son Lincoln O&#8217;Barry exposed the world to the shocking truth of slaughter of thousands of dolphins in Japan in an award winning documentary called &#8216;The Cove&#8217; last year.</p>
<p>Despite opposition from both the Australian and New Zealand governments, Solomons dolphins are captured and sold to aquariums, marine parks and even hotels around the world, often fetching as much as $200,000. The Earth Island Institute&#8217;s effort to stop dolphin trade is believed to have converted the so-called &#8216;Darth-Vader&#8217; of the Solomons’ dolphin trade, the Canadian Chris Porter from a seller to a savior.</p>
<p>Makili said the Solomons government once banned the trade but now, in the pursuit of much-needed revenue, ignored directives by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Though Solomons government allows about 50 from the earlier quota of 100 dolphins, the CITES recommends just 10 numbers.</p>
<p>Some Solomon Islanders still hunt dolphins for food and use their teeth for traditional &#8216;shell money&#8217; but since 2003 they have also been hunted to exploit the lucrative live export market. The documentary ‘The Cove’ had exposed the senseless annual slaughter of approximately 20,000 dolphins at the remote Taiji, Japan.</p>
<p>The O&#8217;Barry father-son combine is showcasing another mini-series on massive ecological crimes happening worldwide. The Animal Planet on August 27, 2010 would be airing a three-part mini-series titled &#8220;Blood Dolphins&#8221;, and would highlight how the tiny nation of nearly 1,000 islands in the South Pacific has emerged as a major challenge in the blood trade of wild dolphins.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nationals&#8217; leader Warren Truss revealed that a Coalition government at the centre would restore funding to exporters and appoint an ambassador for trade reforms and specialist trade representatives for Australia&#8217;s manufacturing and service Industries. An Abbott government would increase the EMDG cap to AUD 200mn from July 1, 2011, restoring an AUD $50mn shortfall caused by Labour government mismanagement, he added.</p>
<p>Truss&#8217; announcement gains prominence following a recent pre-poll survey gave a slight edge for the Coalition to form the next government of Australia. An opinion poll of Newspoll, a market research firm, commissioned by The Australian newspaper has found that the opposition Liberals leading 52 percent to 48 percent over the ruling Labour.</p>
<p>Truss was echoing similar trade plans which the Australian Opposition Leader Tony Abbott announced on Monday for the tourism industry of the country. Abbot declared a Coalition government would spend an extra AUD $90mn (US$82mn) to help attract visitors to Australia.</p>
<p>The tourism package includes an AUD $40mn (US$36mn) fund that would provide grants of up to AUD $100,000 to build infrastructure for tourism projects.</p>
<p>Another AUD $14mn fund would provide grants to tourism organizations in regional areas. Tourism Research Australia will also be provided with AUD $8mn to identify emerging trends and gaps in the market, to make the industry to become more sustainable.</p>
<p>The Coalition sees tourism a niche business to Australia as the industry employs close to 500,000 people and earns AUD $24bn in export earnings. The Opposition has also allocated AUD $27mn for Regional Medical Workforce Plan to increase the number of doctors, nurses and dentists in regional and remote areas of Australia.</p>
<p>Truss said the Coalition would appoint an ambassador for trade reform to promote global trade reform and re-establish the Trade Advisory Council abolished by the Labour. He clarified that the Coalition&#8217;s highest trade priority would be the Doha round of negotiations towards freer world trade, but it would vigorously pursue FTA with China, Japan, Malaysia, the GCC, South Korea and Indonesia.</p>
<p>All details on future plans for trade and industry by the Opposition were laid out during the election campaigns, and were loaded with the Ruling&#8217;s inefficiencies and inequities. Australia&#8217;s general elections will be held on 21 of this month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser&#8217;s address while laying the  groundwork for the FTA talks with Russia has unveiled a strategy that  his country would possibly be effecting the early mover advantage in its  future bilateral and regional trade pacts. The NZ&#8217;s trade negotiations  with Russia may eventually become the world&#8217;s first FTA involving the  latter, which is at the verge of the WTO accession.</p>
<p>The Trade  Minister&#8217;s words were marked by clear ideas on which the country&#8217;s  economic path would be paved in the coming years regardless of its size.  He said NZ started its reform process 30 years ago with very high  protectionist barriers but now was solidly centred on reciprocal trade  liberalisation.</p>
<p>Groser shifted his focus from the FTA talks to  WTO negotiations and expressed dismay over the inertia at the WTO. He  said the WTO negotiating process was suffering from sclerosis, and  criticized the WTO Director General’s use of the metaphor of having done  80 percent of the negotiation.  He added that but last 20 percent or  whatever number one chose to illustrate the remaining negotiating gap &#8211;  was proving elusive.</p>
<p>He arrayed data on NZ trade policies  including the collective effort in the early 1990s that it would not put  all its eggs in the then GATT or now WTO basket. He pointed out since  then, while emphasising multilateral trade policy, successive NZ  Governments had aggressively and successively pursued a bi-partisan  strategy of developing FTAs with economies which were either major  trading partners or promised to be – i.e. the emerging economies.</p>
<p>&#8220;All  projections suggest that in even twenty to thirty years&#8217; time, the  countries with the largest populations will have the largest economies.  We will be living in a truly multi-polar world in which we are highly  likely to have four economic super-powers with huge populations (China,  India, the US and the hybrid model of the 27 Member EU) plus a range of  very significant economies on a second tier including Japan, Korea,  Indonesia and, of course the other of the so-called &#8216;BRICs&#8217; – the  formulation that includes not just China and India but also Brazil and  Russia&#8221;, claimed Groser.</p>
<p>The gist of the address disclosed that  NZ current FTAs including China, Thailand, Singapore and Chile and  future FTAs or any other trade deals  were and will be designed to  follow an extreme application of what is called &#8216;first mover advantage&#8217;  strategy – getting in first, to avoid the possibility of being left to  last.</p>
<p>NZ is the first developed country to have established a  comprehensive FTA with China. Besides, NZ has negotiated a parallel FTA  with Hong Kong – NZ is the only country in the world so far, other than  China itself, to have such a relationship.</p>
<p>At a glance, the  NZ-Russia FTA opens up business opportunities for not only the NZ dairy  industry but also extend to other areas such as agro-tech, tourism and  education. New Zealand’s exports to Russia are worth NZ$187mn ($127mn)  last year, of which about two-thirds are dairy products. That’s just a  fraction of the more than the $30bn of food Russia purchases annually.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent opinion poll on whether terror advisories altered one&#8217;s business itinerary revealed that 54 percent of the respondents went by their intuition and never fell prey to media hype or any such government notifications. The poll which was featured on LinkedIn, the largest business networking site with over 65mn members across the world saw merely 26 percent opting for safety first to diligently follow all travel advisories.</p>
<p>Mary Lascelles Relocation Director at Moving Links 4 You commented &#8220;My son recently went to Kashmir, India where he spent three months working on a project. So many folks advised against it as it was an unsafe place, and the newspapers certainly lead us to believe it was nuts for going. He has now returned and he said he never felt unsafe while there. Goes to show that a lot of times fear is instilled by media hype. Still, it&#8217;s important to use your intuition &#8211; while still living life and not shutting out important experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barbara Holtzman, Executive Consultant &amp; Management Coach said she would follow her intuition and did not avoid any place based on an alert alone, and also endorsed Lascelles&#8217; view. While Sally Shiff Social Network Coordinator at Maoz Inc. opined &#8220;I live in the Middle East (Israel) and have learned to be aware of safety. What we don&#8217;t have here is the theft and harm that I used to see on the streets in the US or as a traveler abroad.&#8221; She later added that the places which were unsafe to travel were often found barricaded, and was glad rather to comply with such warnings.</p>
<p>However, some participants in the poll are of the opinion that it would be unwise to overlook these advisories. Similarly, those in the travel and transport industry are also found to be paying attention to the alerts as they feared it would hurt their businesses.</p>
<p>The poll clarification on as to why ask this question read &#8211; It is observed that advisories are used these days as foreign policy. Instead of pinpointing the terror strike areas, and helping those countries to nab the perpetrators before the event, most governments just release a terror alert to put that country/ies and administration/s in all kinds of trouble.</p>
<p>The recent terror advisories issued by the US, Britain, Australia and Canada on the Indian capital has forced the government to turn New Delhi into a fortress with heavy deployment of security forces and also increased security checks. Furthermore, some analysts believe operatives under the guise of crank callers could be involved in hoax calls (the recent series of anonymous calls about bombs being planted at various locations in New Delhi) to destabilize day to day business of the city.</p>
<p>It should be recalled that in February the Home Minister of India P Chidambaram had said about a US advisory then &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was based on any new information nor do I think that it was intended to send any alarm signal. I think it was a routine advisory and it should be seen as such.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister of Vanuatu Edward Natapei met Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao at Beijing in honour of latter’s invitation. Natapei’s 6-day visit to China is expected give added fillip to the already strong China-Vanuatu bilateral relations.</p>
<p>During the meet, the Chinese premier announced that his country would continue to encourage its enterprises to invest and increase trade with Vanuatu primarily to improve the island nation’s business capabilities. Wen further added that his country was committed to proceed with comprehensive aid package to Vanuatu without any quid pro quo arrangements.</p>
<p>While Natapei reciprocated by saying his country would like to strengthen communication and coordination with China in addressing financial crisis and climate change. Both the premiers were present at the signing ceremony of bilateral agreements on economic and technological co-operation.</p>
<p>Wen observed that the developing countries, in particular, the least developed ones, small island states and African countries, have suffered a lot from global issues including financial crisis and climate change. And therefore he felt, the international community should give meticulous care to countries like Vanuatu to ensure a balanced and sustainable development of the world.</p>
<p>China has confirmed that it would co-operate and support technologically, technically and financially to improve Vanuatu’s citizens’ livelihood along with an accent on infrastructure and personnel training promotion, to enhance the country&#8217;s self-development capabilities. It said that it would try to create several platforms for people to make social exchanges to strengthen bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Vanuatu, an island nation situated in the South Pacific Ocean, off Australia also maintains strong economic and cultural ties with Australia, France, New Zealand and the UK, though it stopped direct aid since 2005. Australia continues to provide support to Vanuatu since its independence in 1980, the bulk of external assistance, including to the police force, which has a paramilitary wing.</p>
<p>Besides his visit to Beijing, Natapei would be covering cities including Changsha, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. He hopes to utilize china’s expertise in different fields for the development of his country through this trip.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand Climate Change Minister Nick Smith told Radio New Zealand that the implementation of Emission Trade Scheme (ETS) would be based on the progress actualized by other developed countries, especially Australia, the US, Japan and Europe. He said if there was no progress, the government would be unlikely to proceed with the step-up in obligations from January 2013.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, both Smith and NZ Prime Minister John Key, at different occasions reiterated that the ETS would take effect on the energy and transport sectors in July despite calls from business groups, farmers and Act, an agro-friendly and anti-ETS organization. The business groups fear NZ firms bearing the cost of the domestic ETS will be competitively disadvantaged compared with rivals from countries with no effective carbon pricing mechanism, a view that is shared by the Federated Farmers and Act.</p>
<p>According to latest reports, apart from the Federated Farmers and Act and nine other business groups including Major Electricity Users&#8217; Group, the Employers and Manufacturers Association (EMA) has also joined the side in exerting pressure on the government to delay international commitment on carbon reduction. The EMA chief executive Alasdair Thompson said &#8220;Our financial situation is far too fragile to absorb the extra $255mn the government calculates the ETS will cost all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Smith claims an average NZ family could expect a meagre 165 NZ dollars (US$116) annual increase in expenses from July, it is estimated, particularly since the ETS would be covering transport and energy, the annual family expenditure would be manifold than his assumption. The ETS would be introduced in come July on the energy, transport and industrial sectors with a 50 percent obligation.</p>
<p>The NZ ETS legislation allows for a formal review of the scheme in 2011 along with an increase in obligations from Jan 1, 2013. The ETS is effective on forestry from 2008; and agriculture, which makes up the half of NZ&#8217;s emissions, will be included in the scheme in 2015. Some of the major reasons for growing opposition in NZ against the ETS are cited as the absence of consensus among many nations on paucity of time on implementation, trade disadvantages, cost escalation on essentials and stringent NZ ETS norms on all sectors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protectionism versus safety took the centre stage of debate between the Rudd administration and the domestic beef industry along with the main opposition while the Australian government declared the removal of ban on beef importation on Monday. Prior to the announcement, the Coalition senators and about 1000 beef producers gathered in Armidale to protest against the government’s possible new ruling.</p>
<p>In 1996, Australia was forced to impose ban on beef imports from the UK and later in 2001 for countries including the US and Canada after these beef exporting nations reported cases of mad cow disease or the BSE. People could contract this disease if they consumed portions of brains or spinal cords of infected animals.</p>
<p>Under the new importation laws, only imports of muscle meat, or products of muscle meat, that is not infected with the BSE will be allowed into Australia. The country of origin must apply to the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) for permission to export beef to the region. The minimum period for the application assessment is fixed at 20 weeks, and if situation warrants, the applicant has to undergo an in-country inspection that could even delay the process beyond the normal time frame.</p>
<p>However, the major exporting nations such as the US and Canada do not meet the Australian stringent safety standards. But the Agriculture Minister of Australia Tony Burke said the country’s strict quarantine standards for beef and other products must not be an excuse for protectionism.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Queensland Nationals Senator Barnaby Joyce and NSW Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan stated they would move a private bill proposing that exporting countries installed the Australian-equivalent testing regimes and traceability standards to protect citizens from eating contaminated beef. Likewise, Nationals Leader Warren Truss as well as Page Nationals candidate, Kevin Hogan voiced similar concerns over the non-labelling of the origin of beef as they felt consumers should have the option to choose what was safe for them.</p>
<p>According to sources, supermarkets including Coles and Woolworths have shown solidarity with the domestic beef industry by declaring that they would only sell the Australian beef. Nevertheless, a spokesman of Woolworths admitted that it would be beyond its control to identify what beef went into processed foods, such as meat pies and canned products.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Avatar, the most expensive and the largest grosser movie ever made has given a big boost to the New Zealand (NZ) film industry and the economy as a whole. The 3D mega visual has delivered USD$218mn to the NZ economy while it was made in the country as against the politically criticized grant of about $32mn.</p>
<p>Penelope Borland, CEO of the Screen Production and Development Association of NZ (SPADA) said the success of Avatar would resonate around the world and alongside NZ&#8217;s huge advances in intellectual property in the film industry. She added Criticism of Avatar&#8217;s box office success relative to the NZ Large Budget Screen Production Grant (LBSPG) it received was short sighted.</p>
<p>Since the inception of the LBSPG in 2003, overseas movie and television productions have spent more than $1bn in NZ, which has resulted in grant payments of $134mn. The industry has received total revenues of $384mn from overseas film companies in 2008, and makes NZ number 3 in the world for foreign exchange revenues behind Canada and the UK.</p>
<p>Under the LBSPG scheme, a 15 percent rebate on total qualifying production expenditure is allowed for movies crossing $10.6mn on expenditure in NZ. The Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee says &#8220;Attracting large budget film productions here offers wider benefits to the economy, including increased opportunities for citizens as well as tourism benefits from having NZ locations shown to an international audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NZ industry is agog with particularly Avatar’s success as many such projects will now move to the country not only for its locales but also to seek technical talents. NZ’s acclaimed visual effects company Weta Digital (WD) is behind the technology that has created the new generation 3D special effects for the movie which, according to the global film fraternity, is the biggest event in the history of film-making since colour film.</p>
<p>WD is already popular with their works in Hollywood blockbusters such as Lord of the Rings and King Kong. WD’s senior visual effects supervisor Joe Letteri claimed that Avatar was the first major international film came to NZ purely for the technological filmmaking knowledge built up there, rather than primarily because of country&#8217;s advantages as a location for shooting.</p>
<p>WD&#8217;s general manager Tom Greally said around 60 percent of the $218mn spent on Avatar in NZ would have gone on crew costs, with the rest going towards “technical infrastructure”. While Film NZ acting CEO Sue Thompson said for the Kiwi industry to continue growing it had to keep marketing itself as a destination for high quality filmmaking.</p>
<p>The success of Avatar and several other movies shot in NZ is expected to give a fillip to the country’s tourism industry too as its tourist destinations are showcased to the global audience in a very tempting manner. However, the NZ film industry feels that any attempt to withdraw grants will discourage overseas film projects coming to the country, and may go elsewhere as some countries offer 30 percent grant upfront whereas NZ paid after the project completion.</p>
<p>Brownlee feels “NZ&#8217;s connection to the success of Avatar will continue to deliver huge benefits to the country and will help to attract larger budget productions here in the future.” He adds “it is unlikely these productions would have decided to film in NZ if this grant had not been available as most locations offered an incentive to film in their territory or country”.</p>
<p>Recent PriceWaterhouseCoopers research: Economic Impact of the Film and Television Industry (2009) in NZ found that the film and television industry contributes $2.5bn to the New Zealand economy and contributes additional financial benefits to the country by enhancing international awareness and equity in the NZ brand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan claimed that his country continued to outperform most other nations even as the impact of the global economic crisis eroded almost all economies. He made this statement ahead of the final economic data to be released before the holiday season by the Australian government this week.</p>
<p>In his weekly economic note, Swan used an analysis of national accounts data, released last week, to highlight the strength of the economy. He largely depended on the data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) which stated that the Australian economy expanded by 1.1 percent in 2008-09 while most advanced nations experienced deep recession.</p>
<p>It is observed that the Labour government’s fiscal stimulus package to the tune of Aus$70bn helped to a great extent to leapfrog the crisis at a faster pace in comparison to other advanced nations. In stark contrast, the major advanced economies contracted by 2.9 percent over the same period, including contractions of 2.2 percent in the US, 3 percent in the UK and 5.1 percent in Japan.</p>
<p>On the contrary, a Reuters survey finds most market watchers now believe the ABS will report that growth actually went backwards in the September quarter &#8211; despite rising employment and booming house prices. The survey said the second quarter recorded 0.6 percent growth whereas just 0.4 is expected of the September quarter with annual growth unchanged at 0.7 percent.</p>
<p>Chief economist Craig James of CommSec, largest stockbroking firm of Australia shared similar views by adding that key spending components of GDP, such as inventories and net exports, were pulling in opposite directions. However, he expressed confidence that growth would rebound this quarter and pick up pace through 2010, underpinned by housing and engineering construction.</p>
<p>In the wake of relative growth projections, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lifted the cash rate this month by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent. The forthcoming minutes of the RBA will give a better picture which way the interest rates will go.</p>

AUSVEG CEO Richard Mulcahy referred a report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics&#8230; <a href="http://www.cosmizen.com/2009/10/aus-vegetable-farmers-bogged-down-by-imports-and-input-costs/">Continue reading</a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to AUSVEG, the peak industry body that represents the Australian vegetable growers, the vegetable industry is troubled by imports and rising input costs. AUSVEG CEO Richard Mulcahy referred a report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) to establish AUSVEG’s finding.</p>
<p>Mulcahy said that findings from an ABARE survey showed a 3 percent fall in vegetable farm incomes on average in 2007-08 were an indication that rising farm input costs and competition from China were affecting the bottom line of Australian vegetable farmers. He pointed out China’s input costs such as labour was significantly lower, and apart from Chinese imports, New Zealand imports too posed serious threat to processed vegetable growers.</p>
<p>ABARE, a professionally independent government economic research agency highlighted in its survey that besides high input costs, marketing costs, low vegetable prices and availability of irrigation water as other impediments to future viability. However, compared with the previous survey, access to and cost of labour was no longer regarded by the majority of vegetable growers as an impediment facing future viability.</p>
<p>The report which was commissioned by Horticulture Australia Limited (HAL) informed that despite adverse seasonal conditions the vegetable growers were able to maintain farm incomes. Although adverse seasonal conditions in many vegetable growing regions in 2007-08 led to a fall in average yields and lower vegetable production, average farm cash incomes of vegetable farms declined by only 3 percent.</p>
<p>ABARE Deputy Executive Director, Dr Terry Sheales while releasing its report stated despite a rise in average prices received for vegetables in 2007-08, overall receipts from the sale of vegetables had fallen by 6 percent on average as seasonal conditions had resulted in lower yields and production. Though input costs have sunk the confidence of 86 percent of vegetable growers, the mood seemed to be upbeat with 72 percent expecting to be still engaged in vegetable growing in five years’ time and 31 percent planning to expand vegetable production in the next three to five years.</p>
<p>The gross value of production of the vegetable industry is estimated about $3.5bn in 2008-09, contributing around 8 percent to Australia’s gross value of agricultural production. Mulcahy felt that to compete with China the country must ensure that input costs were kept down wherever possible, and the benefits of local production for the consumer, such as safer, fresher produce, and a strong local economy that supports Australian jobs, were better understood.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest release of Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) stated that the International Pulses Trade and Industry Confederation (IPTIC) had decided to relocate its headquarters from Europe to Dubai. President of the IPTIC, Dr. Jose Maria Lazara is learned to have said that the decision to shift their base to Dubai is particularly because of its strategic location, free zone advantages, excellent port, shipping and re-export infrastructure which was ideal for further growth of international pulses trade.</p>
<p>The International Pulse Trade and Industry Confederation (IPTIC) is also known by its French name, Confédération Internationale du Commerce et des Industries des Légumes Secs (CICILS). It was established in 1963 and represents 12 national pulse organizations and more than 250 leading companies in 32 countries. The IPTIC undertakes the international pulse trade activities, notably in the International Bodies of the United Nations (OECD, FAO, WHO, Codex Alimentarius), Regional Governmental Organizations (European Union) and International Trade Organizations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the DMCC was formed by the Dubai Government in 2002 to facilitate commodity trading in Dubai to leverage the geographical advantages of the largest pulses trading MENASA region that comprises of the Middle East, North Africa and the South Asia. MENASA accounts for importing almost 4mn tons or 60 percent of global trade in the pulses.</p>
<p>The major relocation reason comes from the fact that besides commodity market infrastructure, the DMCC resident companies are provided with highly attractive benefits under the free zone status, such as, a 50-year guaranteed tax holiday, 100 percent business ownership, full ownership of business premises, and a secure regulated environment.</p>
<p>Major legume trading countries including Australia, Canada, the US, India, China, France, Spain, Turkey and Argentina conduct most of their trading operations under the umbrella of IPTIC. The organization also account for over 60mn tons in pulses production and 100bn dollars of pulses industry at the retail level.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Internet has permeated through all walks of lives, and this has tremendously increased the need for better connectivity. Lately, businesses regardless of being offline or online, view internet and its connectivity as an indispensable part of their business process. However, remote areas and their businesses had to be satisfied with the available connectivity, owing to chiefly, higher cost of laying cables where returns would be minimal for the service providers. Growing hunger for internet usage has spurred technology providers into action to produce a slew of connectivity tools. Among them, two distinct technologies called WiMAX and HSPA emerged to fight it to the hilt for larger share of connectivity pie.</p>
<p>Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) is the technology that allows user to navigate the internet wireless. It is a telecommunication technology that can carry data to long distances either by point to point links or full mobile access. The key feature of this technology is that it operates on the same Broadband Wireless Access Standard of IEEE 802.16, which was set up in 1999. WiMAX also has the ability to extend local Wi-Fi networks over larger expanse of coverage area by up to 50 kilometers and its backed by Intel, world&#8217;s largest semiconductor company.</p>
<p>Similarly, High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) too boasts of superior technology akin to that of WiMAX. In a nutshell, it is a collection of mobile telephony protocols that provide better performance over existing radio bandwidth. Equipped with state of the art 3.5G technology, it can touch amazing download speeds of up to 7.2 Mbps. HSPA should be proud to get the support from leading equipment vendors including Ericsson, Nokia Siemens Networks, Nortel, Alcatel and Lucent. Its proven ability to perform extremely well in any condition and download speeds has helped the technology to be absorbed across several countries in a short span of time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, WiMAX was not without its own problems, in Australia, first WiMAX operator had to shut down its operation due to poor reach to long distances, contrary to its claim. On the other hand, HSPA service was able to produce the desire result in over 50 countries and 150 networks. For example, in some places subscribers could already watch streaming High Definition movies at 1Mbps. HSPA has also got a cost advantage over the other, per month charges as of now is in the realm of $30, whereas one has to shell out $10 more to get the same service from WiMAX.</p>
<p>Since majority of the people spend time outside their workplaces, e-mobility has become an inevitable tool in communication and business. Whether the winner is WiMAX or HSPA, wider expanse of area under internet connectivity through wireless services will enhance people to do day to day business, being anywhere in the world. High speed internet access through wireless technology will propel growth in all areas including business, education and healthcare.</p>
<p>Global internet wireless connectivity will also give an advantage for an entrepreneur who is away from the main markets to get reasonable remuneration for one&#8217;s products or services. Real time e-mobility effects coupled with long distance internet coverage for one&#8217;s communication suggests, E-Commerce will be the biggest gainer and is likely to increase its share in the world of business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US move to re-introduce subsidies to 92,000 tons of dairy exports including milk powder, butter and cheese has been decried by both major dairy producing nations New Zealand and Australia. Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key stated the US decision would prolong the global recession since during the Great Depression in 1930 several countries took similar protectionist measures that in turn deepened the crisis for long.</p>
<p>The US action comes after the EU re-introduced its export subsidy program in early this year. Many industry observers felt these moves would only trigger more protectionist measures from countries those are affected by this action. Though these declared subsidies are within the WTO limits there would be political pressure within the affected countries to retaliate and prompt them to reverse their decision.</p>
<p>Trade Minister Simon Crean and Agriculture Minister Tony Burke of Australia in a joint statement said that they would try to garner support from other countries to pressurize the US to reverse its decision at the Cairns Group Ministerial meeting in Bali in early next month. The Cairns Group is a coalition of 19 agricultural exporting nations which account for over 25 percent of the global agricultural exports that aims to liberalise trade in the respective sector.</p>
<p>New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser said dairy farmers the world over were under pressure, but the US move was a short-sighted response while the international dairy market had recently been showing signs of stabilising. New Zealand is the largest dairy merchandise export earner and second largest meat export earner with nearly 24 and 12 percent share respectively in total goods exported. The price advantage enjoyed by New Zealand dairy products will get diluted in the global market with the re-introduction of US handout to its dairy exports.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the president of the Australian National Farmers’ Federation (NFF) David Crombie warned the US handout would only shore up domestic jobs in the short-term but undermines the possibilities of faster global economic recovery. Similarly, Fonterra, the world’s largest dairy exporter echoed the sentiments of the NFF, contending that the US decision had the potential to damage a world dairy market which remained fragile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second phase of the 14th ASEAN Summit and related summits which is scheduled to be held on 10-12 April in the Thai resort city of Pattaya is feared to be used as a platform for discussing the North Korean satellite launch than addressing the key issues of the region. China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand will be attending the meet, along with the ASEAN, is in fact organized to evaluate the economic climate of the region, and to jointly declare the remedial measures to counter it.</p>
<p>The summit happens to be the first forum after the North Korean satellite launch which has been widely criticized by Japan, South Korea and the western world as an attempt to test its ballistic prowess. As a result, many ASEAN members are concerned about the summit getting reduced to a forum for finding ways to penalise N. Korea for their action rather than meeting region’s economic problems. Earlier, despite the US and its allies headlining the Korea’s satellite launch as rocket launch and urging the UN to impose sanctions, China and Russia had called for patience.</p>
<p>The ASEAN summit was originally planned for last December and postponed with two phases in late February and April respectively this year due to anti-government protests that shut down Bangkok&#8217;s main international airport for several days during the scheduled period. Usually the summit is an annual gathering of representatives or leaders from ASEAN group, but the global economic crisis have compelled the group to include the economic powerhouses of the region in the forthcoming summit.</p>
<p>According to sources, the Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd will once again appeal the participants to review his proposal in last May for an Asia-Pacific Union (APU) in the line of the EU. Rudd’s proposed APU member states account for more than half the population of the world and is worth about half the global economic output. His call is likely to have more takers this time around since the summit has plans to formally denounce any form of protectionism to tide over the current economic mess quickly.</p>
<p>The ASEAN leaders will make sure that the focus is on climate change, which dominated the last summit, will be followed by trade, energy, food security and disaster management. They also hope the meet will include the finer points of the recently concluded G20 Summit to aid struggling economies get out of the present economic quagmire left behind by the global financial and economic crisis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rudd&#8217;s center-left Labor Government has decided to boost the country’s Broadband services by 100 times faster through establishing a public-private partnership company, in which the government will hold majority stake. The formation of a new National Broadband Network Corporation with an initial investment of about $4bn is likely to generate 25,000 jobs every year during the project’s term, and the overall expenditure is estimated at $31bn.</p>
<p>The new network is expected to provide fibre to the premise (FTTP) technology to 90 percent of the population with a staggering speed of 100mbps and the remaining 10 percent who are in remote areas will be offered wireless connectivity with 12mbps. Australia is one of the few advanced countries that have slower internet services. After delivering the plan, the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said “This is a huge enabler for the Australian economy for the 21st century”.</p>
<p>The broadband network public-private venture is the largest nation-building project in the history of Australia. It is the most ambitious and long term nation-building infrastructure project ever undertaken by an Australian government.</p>
<p>Earlier, the government had dumped its national broadband network policy of tendering the project to private companies after failing to derive reasonable value, and fearing delay in the project due to the current global financial situation. Nevertheless, the major players including Telstra and SingTel are learned to have pledged their support to the project.</p>
<p>The government plans to finance the state’s majority stake through Building Australia Fund and then through issuance of Aussie Infrastructure Bonds (AIBs) that will allow retailers and institutions to invest in the mega project. However, after five years of completion, the government will likely divest its majority stake.</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull warned the public that the new project was likely to be three times costlier than the present internet services. An Australian subscriber on an average pays $30 to $40 per month for broadband services.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tragic accident of Chernobyl in 1986 made uranium a devastating term to human race. The fear created by the disaster, immediately reflected on uranium mining and not to mention the price. Even countries with nuclear projects either shelved or delayed the process due to opposition from the public. Till the year 2000 the price of uranium per pound hovered around $7. Gradually the world while scouring for cleaner and cheaper fuel found uranium as the answer to the surging energy needs.</p>
<p>The renewed interest in uranium has taken the mining companies around the world towards the African continent. The countries of Africa currently engaged in mining are Niger, Congo, Malawi, Zambia, Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. The demand for uranium has increased the prices by manifold in the early half of 2007 to $136 per pound before falling back to $93. Most mining companies bet on the African nations because they provide cheap labor and high grade output.</p>
<p>African Energy Resources Ltd., an Australian-owned mining outfit, is drilling on the southern border of Zimbabwe. Canadian-owned mining outfit, Equinox Ltd. is active in the Zambia’s northwestern region. Another Australian firm Paladin Energy Limited is successfully able to mine in the border region of Botswana.</p>
<p>Nuclear energy currently dishes out 16 percent of the world&#8217;s electricity need. The percentage is expected to grow as nations invest in alternatives that are cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas.</p>
<p>There are currently about 440 nuclear reactors around the world. Sixteen are due to retire by 2013, 33 are under construction, 94 are planned and another 222 proposed. As more electricity is produced using uranium, the prices are too expected to rise. Yet uranium will remain one of the cheapest sources of energy until thorium becomes technologically viable.</p>
