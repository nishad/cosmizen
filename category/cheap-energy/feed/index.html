				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An initiative to make use of old rubber trees by a Canadian renewable  energy firm in Liberia is reaping rich dividends to the country’s  economy. The project is reported to have helped the farmers to get  cleared of the old trees and re-planted at no cost with guarantee of  money for the tree trunks.</p>
<p>Buchanan Renewables Power (BRP) began  commercial operations in Liberia two years ago with a complete  rejuvenation package for the non-producing rubber tree estates. The deal  for the farmers includes $2 per tonne of tree trunks, free of cost  re-plantation and for self-use or sale tree remnants which do not go  into the production of wood chips.</p>
<p>Liberia is estimated to have  more than 600,000ha of overgrown and moribund rubber farms. The new  model of rubber re-plantation rids of farmers’ laborious task of  re-claiming their estates by cutting down trees and re-planting them  spending money without revenues for a long period. After planting, the  trees take nearly seven years to start producing rubber.</p>
<p>Usually  rubber trees need to be replaced once they are over 25 years old, and  most of them in Liberia are between 30 and 60 years old. While helping  farmers, the new project will also provide electricity to communities in  the vicinity as well as has opened up exports to the woodchip markets  of Europe.</p>
<p>BRP uses massive diggers to uproot trees and a giant  mincer to produce rubber wood chips out of the trunks. The company has  exported 45,000MT of chips last year with contracts of about 90,000MT  for this year; and plans to clear 10,000ha annually.</p>
<p>The Buchanan  claims that it has the capacity to produce 400,000 tonnes of woodchips  per annum. Besides, on many farms, it has been able to plant two trees  for every one that has been harvested.</p>
<p>For Liberia it means that  many of its citizens will be re-injected to the market with jobs and  businesses, a dire need of the country that promises opportunities and  improved living standards after the end of seven years of civil war. BRP  says its vision is to achieve success in Liberia and repeat this model  in other countries in Africa and, to the extent possible, worldwide.</p>
<p>The  firm which emphasizes on cheap, environment-friendly and sustainable  energy production with a social commitment to Liberia is putting back  some of its revenues for power generation using the locally sourced wood  chips. However, the proposed 35MW power generation plant at Monrovia  which is supposed to provide electricity for half the price has not been  installed yet even two years after its approval.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tragic accident of Chernobyl in 1986 made uranium a devastating term to human race. The fear created by the disaster, immediately reflected on uranium mining and not to mention the price. Even countries with nuclear projects either shelved or delayed the process due to opposition from the public. Till the year 2000 the price of uranium per pound hovered around $7. Gradually the world while scouring for cleaner and cheaper fuel found uranium as the answer to the surging energy needs.</p>
<p>The renewed interest in uranium has taken the mining companies around the world towards the African continent. The countries of Africa currently engaged in mining are Niger, Congo, Malawi, Zambia, Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. The demand for uranium has increased the prices by manifold in the early half of 2007 to $136 per pound before falling back to $93. Most mining companies bet on the African nations because they provide cheap labor and high grade output.</p>
<p>African Energy Resources Ltd., an Australian-owned mining outfit, is drilling on the southern border of Zimbabwe. Canadian-owned mining outfit, Equinox Ltd. is active in the Zambia’s northwestern region. Another Australian firm Paladin Energy Limited is successfully able to mine in the border region of Botswana.</p>
<p>Nuclear energy currently dishes out 16 percent of the world&#8217;s electricity need. The percentage is expected to grow as nations invest in alternatives that are cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas.</p>
<p>There are currently about 440 nuclear reactors around the world. Sixteen are due to retire by 2013, 33 are under construction, 94 are planned and another 222 proposed. As more electricity is produced using uranium, the prices are too expected to rise. Yet uranium will remain one of the cheapest sources of energy until thorium becomes technologically viable.</p>
