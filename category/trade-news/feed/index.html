				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to boost trade ties with Hong Kong, Taiwan plans to simplify procedures for visa issuance for Hong Kong citizens in the near future, the Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said on Monday. Lai expressed this at a meeting with the visiting highest ranking official from Hong Kong, John Tsang &#8211; Financial Secretary and honorary member of Hong Kong council.</p>
<p>During a meeting in Taipei to promote economic and cultural co-operation between Taiwan and Hong Kong Lai told civilian exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong had largely contributed to lay firm foundation for economic co-operation between the two sides. While Tsang who was on a four-day visit to Taiwan for the first bilateral talks said there should be more such high level exchanges to strengthen the ties.</p>
<p>Both countries are understood to have agreed to co-operate further in the areas of air transport, double taxation avoidance, tourism, health, culture and education. The meeting between the top officials from both sides is regarded as a major step forward in thawing of China-Taiwan relations. The meeting was part of the deal which Taiwan signed with mainland China in June.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is Taiwan&#8217;s fourth-largest trade partner, and two-way trade and the number of travelers between the two sides are expected to reach $38.8bn and 3mn respectively. The number of China-based Taiwanese businesses listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has reached 60, and some leading Taiwanese companies now consider Hong Kong as the main place for raising business capital.</p>
<p>Lai pointed out that to lay emphasis on promoting civilian exchanges between the two sides, the government last year relaxed employment restrictions on Hong Kong students, allowing them to enroll in graduate programs after graduating from local universities, and also began extending the duration of stay on visas for Hong Kong-based Chinese citizens visiting Taiwan. However, she admitted there were still some areas which require special attention to extract full result out of the trade ties with Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Lai was of the opinion that an announcement would be made soon on simplification of visa procedures for Hong Kong visitors. Besides Tsang, the meeting was also attended by Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural Co-operation Council (ECCC) Chairman Lin Chen-kuo and its Hong Kong counterpart, the Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic and Cultural Co-operation and Promotion Council (ECCPC) Lee Y.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An analysis on investments in Ghana finds that an old law is restricting foreign investments to that country as it prescribes unreasonable minimum investment limit while leaving out domestic ones from the legal periphery. The business entities mainly run by the Nigerian traders claim that their businesses are being targeted on the basis of an obsolete decree that stipulates minimum investment of $30,000.</p>
<p>According to GhanaWeb, Ghana&#8217;s investment rules can protect some indigenous businesses against some foreign companies in the short term, and to the detriment of consumers, but this is dwarfed by the economic loss it will cause in the medium to long term. It said the protected local industries and businesses produced inferior goods and were unable to compete on price as they had little incentive to increase productivity, and gave few options to the consumers.</p>
<p>It also suggests that business and trade restrictions make Ghanaian consumers suffer higher prices and undermine sustainable, widespread economic growth. It further indicates that Ghana must evaluate the implications of investment limit since Ghana itself is a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</p>
<p>On the contrary, earlier this month, Hanna S. Tetteh, Ghana Minister of Trade and Industry had said that &#8220;Now as far as businesses between Ghana and Nigeria are concerned, again from our point of view, we do not have a problem. The issue has been a misrepresentation of the legal position as it stands with regards to business.&#8221; She further added that some regulations were in place to protect jobs and petty businesses of the locals.</p>
<p>Despite the obstacles, trade between Nigeria and Ghana in recent years has quadrupled to $525mn in 2008 &#8211; but mainly consists of oil. Nigeria earned $89mn in non-oil exports to Ghana (out of $500mn overall exports), while Ghana&#8217;s exports to Nigeria reached $25mn. Nonetheless, Nigerians have investments of nearly $6bn in Ghana, boosting jobs, creating wealth and bolstering taxable revenue. According to the Africa Economic Outlook report 2010, only 10 percent of the continent&#8217;s total exports are traded within Africa: trade barriers between African nations are the highest in the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry in its latest release said that the firms within Dubai&#8217;s free zones had traded $30.5bn worth of exports and re-exports last year to register a whopping 40.7 percent growth in 2009. Thus proving the world that Dubai is one of the business centers which has woken up from the global economic slumber sparked off by financial crisis in the US three years ago.</p>
<p>The Gulf News reported about $41.5bn worth of imports or 32.6 percent of Dubai&#8217;s total imports — valued at $85.5bn — were carried out by companies in the free zones in 2009. Dubai houses around 20 free zones with more than 20,000 companies, and major imports, exports and re-exports happen via Jebel Ali Free Zone, Technopark and Dubai Airport Free Zone (DAFZ).</p>
<p>Albeit Dubai does not produce oil as compared to other key trade centers in the Middle East to fuel the economy, it relies solely on various business processes of exim trade. Dubai free trade zones are understood to have grown largely owing to its transit point status between growing economies of Asia and Africa as well as plunging into free zone strategy much early on.</p>
<p>Dubai&#8217;s first free zone was launched in the early 1980s when the government commissioned Jebel Ali port — now the main trading hub of the Middle East. The free zones across the globe have prospered mainly due to the possibilities of having controlling stake in investments and repatriable revenue generation opportunities.</p>
<p>And Dubai is case in point to it as foreigners can own 100 percent stake in companies within the free zones. It should be noted the UAE&#8217;s Commercial Companies Law restricts foreign investment in private companies to 49 percent and foreigners cannot do business without a local partner except at free zones.</p>
<p>Last week, DAFZ said it had recorded a 63 percent jump in sale during the first half of this year while Ras Al Khaimah Free Trade Zone reported that 785 companies have already registered for businesses during the first half of the year. Hamad Bu Amim, Director General of Dubai Chamber, said, &#8220;Dubai&#8217;s free zones are a major source of attraction for global companies and firms due to the many advantages they offer to investors looking for all the benefits of operating in the designated free zone areas.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The dolphin trading by one of the Solomon Islands&#8217; exporter has not gone well with a leading animal right organization. Solomons dolphin activist Lawrence Makili who is the Earth Island Institute&#8217;s Pacific Regional Director has told AAP that despite the institute&#8217;s tireless efforts to end the live trade, one dolphin dealer had retarded the momentum.</p>
<p>But Francis Chow, a local businessman who is blamed for restraining and stressing out eight dolphins in a tiny shallow pool for six months informed that his park was neither killing nor breaking any laws on dolphin trade rather exporting them to marine parks in Australia or the US. In response to the protest, Chow said the hypocrite protestors should stop driving Japanese cars, and should harass the Japanese whalers.</p>
<p>However, Chow seemed to be unaware of the fact the people behind the protest played a part to delay Japanese dolphin or whaling hunt last season. Renowned dolphin activist and member of Earth Island Institute&#8217;s Marine Mammal Team Ric O&#8217;Barry along with his son Lincoln O&#8217;Barry exposed the world to the shocking truth of slaughter of thousands of dolphins in Japan in an award winning documentary called &#8216;The Cove&#8217; last year.</p>
<p>Despite opposition from both the Australian and New Zealand governments, Solomons dolphins are captured and sold to aquariums, marine parks and even hotels around the world, often fetching as much as $200,000. The Earth Island Institute&#8217;s effort to stop dolphin trade is believed to have converted the so-called &#8216;Darth-Vader&#8217; of the Solomons’ dolphin trade, the Canadian Chris Porter from a seller to a savior.</p>
<p>Makili said the Solomons government once banned the trade but now, in the pursuit of much-needed revenue, ignored directives by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Though Solomons government allows about 50 from the earlier quota of 100 dolphins, the CITES recommends just 10 numbers.</p>
<p>Some Solomon Islanders still hunt dolphins for food and use their teeth for traditional &#8216;shell money&#8217; but since 2003 they have also been hunted to exploit the lucrative live export market. The documentary ‘The Cove’ had exposed the senseless annual slaughter of approximately 20,000 dolphins at the remote Taiji, Japan.</p>
<p>The O&#8217;Barry father-son combine is showcasing another mini-series on massive ecological crimes happening worldwide. The Animal Planet on August 27, 2010 would be airing a three-part mini-series titled &#8220;Blood Dolphins&#8221;, and would highlight how the tiny nation of nearly 1,000 islands in the South Pacific has emerged as a major challenge in the blood trade of wild dolphins.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Thai Chamber of Commerce (TCC) has suggested that the country should capitalize on business opportunities in South America, particularly Brazil as the Latin America leading economy is preparing to host 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. The TCC through a survey has identified prospective sectors including furniture, food, plastics, spa products, herbs, auto parts and construction materials for Thai trade exploration in Brazil and elsewhere in the region.</p>
<p>Somkiat Anuras, vice-chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (TCC) said that Brazil along with other Latin American countries offered Thailand great potential, its vast population and resources as well as high purchasing power. Anuras who travelled with a trade delegation led by Thailand Trade Representative Vachara Panchet last month to Brazil and Panama added that most Thai exporters still remained reluctant to tap into the region despite immense opportunities.</p>
<p>The chamber has recently modified it projections on Thai exports to the Latin America region by $7.5bn for this year from $5bn. While the earlier forecast between this year and 2015 was $10bn but latest release says those figures could go up to $15bn per annum in the coming years.</p>
<p>The TCC vice chairman said as the world was eager to trade with Brazil owing to its growing economic status, the chamber was not far behind to take stock of the situation. While Brazil, South America&#8217;s biggest economy and the world&#8217;s eighth largest, commences work on 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, the chamber regards that it may provide opportunities for Thai contractors and souvenir producers.</p>
<p>Anuras opines that the Thai investors must forge joint ventures with the Brazilian infrastructure developers to derive infrastructure building opportunities which will be surfacing with the preparation of two mega sporting events. Brazil is expected to spend billions of dollars for add on construction of basic infrastructure, buildings, offices and residences as well as sports arenas, hospitals, hotels and shopping complexes.</p>
<p>Last year, Thailand exported chiefly, automobiles and parts, rubber and machinery to Brazil US$1.22bn worth goods. Although the bilateral trade accrued a trade deficit of $880mn against Thailand due to imports totaling $2.1bn, Brazil still remains the largest trade partner of Thailand in the region.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Swiss President Doris Leuthard&#8217;s week-long visit to China is likely to make Switzerland once again a first mover from Europe to sign an FTA with China as it had established diplomatic ties 60 years ago. The Swiss Embassy to China apprised Global Times that the FTA talks were officially launched.</p>
<p>Leuthard, who ended a six-day working visit to China on Sunday, had said that the feasibility study which began in 2009 had covered all potential areas of trade. Sun Xiaolan, assistant to the Commerce Department of the Swiss Embassy to China said on Monday the FTA talks had officially kicked off.</p>
<p>Although Sun did not disclose the detail of the initial talks but confirmed that Switzerland would soon be the first European country to conclude an FTA with China, as it was with Japan in 2009. Switzerland has the distinction of becoming one of the first Western countries to establish diplomatic relations with China, today to transform itself into a major trading partner from the region.</p>
<p>The top Chinese legislator Wu Bangguo, while he met Leuthard had said the two nations could explore new ways to better combine Swiss technology with the Chinese market. Similarly, the Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said the country had &#8216;enormous demand&#8217; for Swiss products relating to environmental protection, energy conservation and emissions reduction.</p>
<p>Switzerland is China&#8217;s ninth largest European trade partner, while China is Switzerland&#8217;s fourth largest global trade partner. In the first half of this year, bilateral trade jumped 127 percent, and China&#8217;s imports from Switzerland increased 180 percent compared to the same time last year.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Commerce, bilateral trade between China and Switzerland topped $11.3bn in 2008, and slightly dropped to $10.18bn in 2009, with $5.28bn of Swiss exports and $4.9bn imports from China.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Philippines aims to become Asia&#8217;s next big gambling hub by building casinos and related entertainment zones across the country amid controversy. According to Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), an &#8220;Entertainment City&#8221; will come up in Manila to rival Macau and Singapore, the regional titans in the gambling trade, and is expected to be completed by 2014.</p>
<p>Nancy Reyes Lumen, Editor in Chief of Cook Magazine in her blog claimed that last week&#8217;s church sermons peppered the new government&#8217;s policy by making a clarion call &#8211; &#8220;No to Casinos, no to resorts, no to motels, no to Shabu (meth/illegal drugs).&#8221; While the Philippines Inquirer reported that &#8220;The lure of easy money is being promoted by some very powerful men&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is feared that these gambling centres may become focal point of other &#8220;shadow&#8221; industries common to casino culture. The blog added that illegal recruiters were on the prowl to lure hapless poor girls (and boys), offering jobs as maids or entertainers, eventually landing them in flesh trade.</p>
<p>Cristino Naguiat, chairman of the PAGCOR informed AFP on Tuesday &#8220;We are way behind Macau and Singapore in terms of the casino industry&#8230; (but) we would like to be positioned right at the top.&#8221; He also revealed that &#8220;Like other Asian gambling industries, the Philippines wants to tap into the vast mainland Chinese market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new government of President Benigno Aquino, which took office on June 30, has suspended issuing fresh licenses to casinos giving free hand to existing operators in the country to monopolistically control the gambling industry. There are four licensees, and each is required to spend at least one billion dollars in developing the ambitious Entertainment City.</p>
<p>The four licenses to build the Entertainment City on reclaimed land along Manila Bay were awarded in 2008 under the former President Gloria Arroyo. The moment the government announced its decision to exploit revenue generation through gambling, the shares of the licensees hit new highs in the stock market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the recent data released by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply of Brazil indicate that the country’s exports to the Arab region have increased by leaps and bounds. Brazil&#8217;s agri-business has posted 40 percent growth in yearly month on month basis to the Arab world which includes Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Algeria and Jordan.</p>
<p>Brazilian agricultural exports reached $ 7.33bn in July, representing growth of 16.6 percent as compared to the same month last year. With a similar yardstick, the sales to the Arab countries grew by almost 40 percent, a growth rate second only to shipments to the Latin American Integration Association (Aladi) member states.</p>
<p>The data shows that four countries from the Arab region have featured in the list of leading 20 export destinations of Brazil. They are &#8211; Iran at 5th place behind China, the US, the Netherlands and Russia, and Saudi Arabia in the 10th position, Egypt at13th and the UAE at No.17 appeared on the new list.</p>
<p>Over the past few years&#8217; trade between Brazil and Arab countries have witnessed enormous growth after Lula administration reached out to the Arab world in a stand out manner. It should be recalled the Brazil’s Minister of Agriculture Wagner Rossi informed last month that &#8220;President Lula holds the Arab countries in very high esteem. Our trade relations are increasing and will surely develop a lot, because we are complementary economies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brazilian agribusiness exports to the Arab countries increased by 17.2 percent in the first half of 2010 over the same period of 2009, having gone from $2.9bn to $3.4bn. The most shipped products to the Arab region were sugar and meat, whose combined sales constituted 84 percent of Brazilian agribusiness exports.</p>
<p>Last month&#8217;s Brazilian exports of sugar and ethanol recorded growth of 44.3 percent, meat at 22.4 percent, forestry products 21.9 percent, coffee 32.4 percent, leathers 31.7 percent and livestock 65 percent. In the first two quarters, export revenues totalled $ 42.3bn, 12.1 percent more than of the same period of last year. The highlights pointed out by the ministry include greater exports to two Arab countries &#8211; Egypt 54.4 percent and the UAE 22 percent. While imports from the region, largely fertilizers, too recorded huge growth at $ 1.13bn, a rise of 42 percent over the same month of 2009.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100 industrialists from the US are touring Columbia to identify potential areas of trade, and maximize their business prospects under the new regime before it is too late as the new president of Columbia is equi-distant in ideology with all schools of thoughts in the Americas. Juan Manual Santos, the 59th president of Colombia, though had vowed to continue his predecessor&#8217;s business-friendly economic policies, which had a US-centric face, the delay in the US-Columbia FTA is feared to surrender business to other players in the region.</p>
<p>Already the recently concluded Canada-Columbia FTA has adversely impacted the US wheat exports. The agreement has given Canada an immediate price advantage over the US wheat, which hitherto enjoyed a dominant market share in Columbia. The thaw in Columbia-Venezuela ties with a visit by Santos to Venezuela signals that the number of players in the Columbian marketplace is bound to rise rapidly in the coming days.</p>
<p>The business team is understood to have held meetings with the Bogota Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Commerce; and would proceed to Cali, Medellin, Barranquilla, the coffee region, and other key industrial areas of the country. The US commercial representative in Colombia, Margaret Hanson earlier had expressed a desire to see the stalled FTA between Colombia and the US ratified since the Latin American nation already had open access to the US market for almost all its products but the US did not have backwards &#8211; so in terms of common sense, it was hoped that the FTA should happen soon.</p>
<p>Likewise, Colombia&#8217;s new ambassador to the US Gabriel Silva said that one of his first tasks would be to kick-start the FTA talks, and added that his country regarded itself as an economic force in the medium term as Colombia&#8217;s exports were put at $40bn. The trade deal, which involves the reduction of customs duties and other obstacles to trade, was signed by the former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and the former US President George Bush in 2006. While Colombia&#8217;s Congress was quick to pass the treaty, the Obama administration has yet to ratify it.</p>
<p>During his presidential election campaign, Barack Obama opposed approving a trade deal with the Andean nation since crimes against the Colombian trade-union leaders remained unprosecuted. As president, Obama has expressed a willingness to push the deal through, provided that Colombia meets certain human rights conditions.</p>
<p>Colombia is believed to provide scope for investments in sectors including plastics, textiles and food stuff. According to Hanson, the delegation comprises of representatives from the security sector, construction, food, plastics, and also a financier who funds companies, particularly the SMEs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nationals&#8217; leader Warren Truss revealed that a Coalition government at the centre would restore funding to exporters and appoint an ambassador for trade reforms and specialist trade representatives for Australia&#8217;s manufacturing and service Industries. An Abbott government would increase the EMDG cap to AUD 200mn from July 1, 2011, restoring an AUD $50mn shortfall caused by Labour government mismanagement, he added.</p>
<p>Truss&#8217; announcement gains prominence following a recent pre-poll survey gave a slight edge for the Coalition to form the next government of Australia. An opinion poll of Newspoll, a market research firm, commissioned by The Australian newspaper has found that the opposition Liberals leading 52 percent to 48 percent over the ruling Labour.</p>
<p>Truss was echoing similar trade plans which the Australian Opposition Leader Tony Abbott announced on Monday for the tourism industry of the country. Abbot declared a Coalition government would spend an extra AUD $90mn (US$82mn) to help attract visitors to Australia.</p>
<p>The tourism package includes an AUD $40mn (US$36mn) fund that would provide grants of up to AUD $100,000 to build infrastructure for tourism projects.</p>
<p>Another AUD $14mn fund would provide grants to tourism organizations in regional areas. Tourism Research Australia will also be provided with AUD $8mn to identify emerging trends and gaps in the market, to make the industry to become more sustainable.</p>
<p>The Coalition sees tourism a niche business to Australia as the industry employs close to 500,000 people and earns AUD $24bn in export earnings. The Opposition has also allocated AUD $27mn for Regional Medical Workforce Plan to increase the number of doctors, nurses and dentists in regional and remote areas of Australia.</p>
<p>Truss said the Coalition would appoint an ambassador for trade reform to promote global trade reform and re-establish the Trade Advisory Council abolished by the Labour. He clarified that the Coalition&#8217;s highest trade priority would be the Doha round of negotiations towards freer world trade, but it would vigorously pursue FTA with China, Japan, Malaysia, the GCC, South Korea and Indonesia.</p>
<p>All details on future plans for trade and industry by the Opposition were laid out during the election campaigns, and were loaded with the Ruling&#8217;s inefficiencies and inequities. Australia&#8217;s general elections will be held on 21 of this month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wraith of global meltdown is still resonating in some form or the other in most outsourcing dependent countries. The recent Cambodia garment workers’ strike turns out to be a perfect case in point to the premise.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Cambodian police with riot gears thwarted a week-long strike sparked off by the suspension of a union official at a Malaysian-owned garment factory, which produced goods for international brands including Gap, Benetton, Adidas and Puma. It has been reported that the clashes between more than 100 armed police force and 3,000 garment workers in Phnom Penh had resulted in nine women being hurt, though authorities maintain the operations did not hurt anyone.</p>
<p>The BBC&#8217;s Guy De Launey in Phnom Penh says the unrest could be a symptom of a wider social malaise owing to dwindling orders in Cambodia&#8217;s crucial garment industry which resulted in tens of thousands of job losses. Early this month, government increased the minimum wage from about $50 to $60, but the double-digit inflation and the trade unions demands of above $80 seemed to be bogging down the effect.</p>
<p>Albeit the unions retracted from a three-day general strike in protest against the meagre rise, the union official’s suspension is believed to have aggravated the situation. But last week’s Huffington Post report interpreted these strikes as a knee-jerk reaction to irrational calibration of wages by the outsourcing firms or associated agencies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in last week’s blog by Auret van Heerden, President and CEO of the Fair Labour Association visualizes firms that build strong Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes into their operations and culture would have the edge in many markets. Nevertheless, evidences show such practices by firms are beyond procurement principles as it solely reckons pricing and related aspects devoid of labour rights &#8211; especially post-meltdown.</p>
<p>Cambodia’s textile industry accounts for around 85 percent of exports, and is the country’s third-largest source of income after tourism and agriculture. The Southeast Asian state continues to be in the grip of labour problems particularly after the global economic crisis that bombed exports severely to create an economic landscape of joblessness &#8211; and desertion of production units by the employers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese trade expert in an interview to the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper and arm of People’s Daily told many Chinese companies had lost money while trading and investing in North Korea as the country often changed its policies. Gao Xinli, a professor of international economy and trade at Eastern Liaoning University divulged this during an exclusive to the GT.</p>
<p>While responding to the GT reporter Li Yanjie&#8217;s query about the investment environment in N Korea, Gao said North Korea had low credibility. However, he admitted though in the short term there was a high level of risk, but in the long term Chinese companies might benefit from investing there.</p>
<p>The history of Sino-North Korean trade dates back to 1954 as China&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Trade, as it was then known, approved border trade between both sides in regards to local residents&#8217; demands for food items. At that time, China&#8217;s main exports to North Korea were clothes, paper, textile pigments and other light industry products, and China imported seafood and fruits from the North.</p>
<p>Between 1971 and 1981the trade was interrupted, it got revived since 1982 to hit a trade volume of about $540,000, and grew manifold to reach at around $52.08mn in 1989. According to the Dandong statistics department, the trade volume between Dandong, the main border province and North Korea increased from $15.39mn to $314mn between 1990 and 2004.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1990s, the bilateral trade accounted for only 11.6 percent of North Korea&#8217;s total foreign trade volume. But by mid-1990s, the border trade reached around 30 percent of North Korea&#8217;s total foreign trade volume. However, North Korea&#8217;s economy went through a recession during the latter half of 1990s, causing slide in trade.</p>
<p>Gao further added that since 2001, Sino-North Korean trade volume had grown rapidly due to two reasons, one being economic sanctions, and other as China needed the Korean mineral resources in exchange of food. According to the statistics from China&#8217;s Ministry of Commerce, by 2007, the two-way trade has reached 41.71 percent of North Korea&#8217;s total foreign trade volume.</p>
<p>Although the recent accidental killings of three Chinese by the North Korean border guards have earned nation-wide ire from the people of China, the ties seemed to be strong as North Korean administration is purportedly willing to reciprocate to any Chinese call amicably. Furthermore, Pyongyang has no option other than yield to any kind of Chinese pressure, if applied, as it is hugely dependent on China in diplomatic and trading needs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Free Trade Agreement between Mercosur and Egypt is expected to label poultry in the sensitive category as the latter fears it may adversely impact the domestic industry. According to the Al-Masry Al-Youm, an Egyptian daily, Egypt has asked for poultry products and other food commodities to be included in a list of sensitive products on which duties could not be reduced.</p>
<p>The trade deal is likely to be concluded with the fifth round of negotiations at the sidelines of Mercosur summit in Buenos Aires at the end of this month which the Trade Minister of Egypt Rachid Mohamed Rachid would be participating. The Mercosur is a free trade region of South America comprising of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.</p>
<p>A reliable source from the Egyptian Ministry of Trade and Industry is reported to have informed the Egyptian daily that it had agreed with Mercosur to implement the deal in a phased manner by setting up five categories for specific commodities and products.</p>
<p>The first category, which includes intermediate goods and raw materials, will be tariff-free from the effective date of the FTA. The second group&#8217;s duties will be removed over a period of four years, the third one&#8217;s over eight years, and the fourth over ten years. However, the time period for the fifth category has yet to be worked out as it includes highly sensitive products, and feared to negatively affect the local businesses.</p>
<p>Egypt is understood to have requested Mercosur to include textiles, clothes, construction materials, and engineering and chemical products among the first category. Egypt&#8217;s main exports are petroleum, aluminium, raw cotton and leather, whereas it mainly imports poultry, oils, sugar, soya beans and meat. Once the accord is signed, it will become the second FTA that the Mercosur is signing with a non-Latin American nation after Israel.</p>
<p>Last month, Evandro Didonet, the head of the Department of Foreign Negotiations at the Brazilian foreign office (Itamaraty) observed that the FTA with Egypt was &#8220;of the greatest importance&#8221;, as Egypt was one of the countries with the greatest weight in the Arab world. In his evaluation, it should grant &#8220;great visibility&#8221; to the South American bloc and open a &#8220;gateway&#8221; into the Middle East and North Africa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The trade treaty signed on Sunday between Pakistan and Afghanistan has become a major embarrassment to the visiting US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the deal conspicuously disallows Indian exports to Afghanistan through Wagah border while permitting Afghani exports to India. In recent times, Clinton has projected herself as a peace merchant who encouraged both nuclear nations of the sub-continent to improve diplomatic ties, and thereby facilitate peace in the region.</p>
<p>The shutting of doors to Indian exports is seen as a retaliatory measure, or as to garner more items on the negotiating table while both sides meet again in the ongoing bilateral talks. The case in point for the payback is that India does not allow transit facilities to Pakistan&#8217;s exports to Nepal and Bhutan.</p>
<p>At a glance, the accord hugely favours Pakistan as its goods gain access through Afghanistan to Central Asian countries including lucrative markets of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The amended trade deal was signed by Pakistan Commerce Minister Amin Fahim and his Afghan counterpart Anwarul Haq in the presence of Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Islamabad has for long resisted pressure from Kabul to allow the export of Indian goods by land through Pakistani territory. However, this long-standing demand by both Afghanistan and India seemed to impact more the poor of the region than the governments of the nations involved.</p>
<p>The failures of protracted farcical talks between India and Pakistan continue to push every possible event to be used as a tool to blatantly demonstrate displeasure with one another&#8217;s actions. Lately, while Islamabad refuses to give India the Most Favoured Nation status, Delhi has raised both tariff and non-tariff barriers to restrict Pakistan&#8217;s exports.</p>
<p>It is yet to be seen whether Clinton would be able to play a meaningful role in the region to re-weld the two nuclear states for ushering in peace and prosperity to the region. But given the frequent border tensions and unrest in Kashmir after a respite indicate that any time in near future it is unlikely the two governments giving in to allow each other land transit rights.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish Foreign Minister&#8217;s one day visit to Portugal has culminated in the signing of a mutually beneficial partial visa exemption agreement. According to the deal, citizens of both countries who have special or service passports will be able to travel to each other&#8217;s country without a visa for 90 days within a six-month-period.</p>
<p>During the visit to the Portugal&#8217;s capital Lisbon, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with his Portuguese counterpart Luis Amado for the signing of the deal as well as to hold diplomatic talks. Davutoglu while signing the accord stated the bilateral trade between Turkey and Portugal had reached $826mn last year, and there was great prospect of improving from the current value.</p>
<p>Now the deal will go through a formal ratification process by both the countries&#8217; parliaments. The effective date will be declared once the deal is approved by the respective houses.</p>
<p>The similar facilitation of the new deal has been a longstanding demand of Turkey with the EU as agreements signed by the EU and Turkey necessitate that Turks be exempted from visas. However, the EU&#8217;s recent nod to three Balkan states including Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro for visa-free travel to their nationals has heightened the Turkish demand for such relaxation is extended to its citizens too.</p>
<p>It should be recalled, last year, the European Court of Justice has issued a ruling paving the way for Turkish businesspeople providing services in the EU member states to enter the EU without having to obtain visas first under a 1973 deal called the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement. While speaking at the occasion, the Portuguese Foreign Minister said that Portugal hoped the membership negotiations would be concluded as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At the sidelines of his official visit, the Turkish Foreign Minister also met up with the visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki to discuss bilateral co-operation and trilateral agreements on exchange of fuel for the Tehran research reactor. A tripartite agreement on the exchange of uranium was reached May 17 between Iran, Turkey and Brazil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Viet Nam Ambassador to Myanmar feels that Myanmar has all the trappings of providing big returns for investments ranging from mining, forestry management, agriculture and aquaculture to telecommunication, tourism and health-care services. Myanmar had a population of 56mn, and it was a large market for consumer products since its local production only met 13 percent of demand, clarified Chu Cong Phung.</p>
<p>Myanmar and Viet Nam have similar history and share almost identical culture and religion. While Viet Nam suffered boycott by the West in the past Myanmar continues to be ostracized by the US and the EU as well.</p>
<p>Phung who is active in Myanmar for some time with humanitarian aid became confident about its market following the back to back success of two trade fairs held to promote Vietnamese products in Yangon last September and April. Although the two-way trade between both sides last year was a meagre $74mn, the first half of this year is showing an uptick by recording $58mn.</p>
<p>Viet Nam exports steel products, cement, processed foods, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and electrical goods and other appliances. On the other hand, Myanmar&#8217;s main exports to Viet Nam are wood and forestry products, natural rubber and seafood.</p>
<p>According to the Association of Vietnamese Investors in Myanmar, Vietnamese enterprises have pledged investments of nearly $1bn in Myanmar this year, well short of their investments in the neighbouring Laos and Cambodia of about $6bn each. But Phung believes that the coming years will witness a greater interest among Vietnamese businesses to tap the new market as there is huge demand for their products in Myanmar on account of their quality, range and reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Phung admitted that the businesses would have to undergo challenges such as tortuous import licensing procedures and difficulties in getting payments, major reason being the US and the EU embargo against Myanmar. But he advised Vietnamese enterprises to strictly follow the guidelines of the Vietnamese embassy in Myanmar and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and do financial transactions only through designated banks.</p>
<p>Under British colonial era, Myanmar was the second-wealthiest country in South-East Asia but the country is one of the poorest in the region today. Viet Nam aspires to make Myanmar as developed as itself through exchanges as the former too emerged from the shadows of prolonged sanctions from the West.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The East African Common Market (EACM) which came into force on July 1 is expected reduce prices of household items as the new &#8216;competitive&#8217; market environment will trigger some price shake-up on many consumables. Though the EACM may take almost five years to become fully operational, the consumers of East African Community (EAC), Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda are likely to experience price stabilization much early on.</p>
<p>Uganda branch manager Joshua Ng&#8217;ang&#8217;a of Nakumatt, a Kenyan supermarket chain said at least commodities in the Ugandan supermarkets would see about 20 percent cut as the imports were overpriced to the tune of same percentage. Besides discounted prices, improvement in quality and increase in variety of items is also anticipated from the start of the common market since producers will have to compete with similar business entities among the EAC member states.</p>
<p>Ng&#8217;ang&#8217;a argued that one of the other reasons for price reduction apart from competition would be the elimination of middlemen from the procurement scene, allowing the supermarkets to directly source from the producers or manufacturers. According to East African Business Week, the leading supermarkets in Uganda are tight-lipped about the future developments in the retail sector.</p>
<p>Last November, the member states of the EAC signed a common market protocol, aimed at expanding the existing customs union. It is commonplace to economies those form blocs to envisage increased competition along with the free movement of services, capital, entrepreneurship and labour across the member states.</p>
<p>In the absence of trade barriers, the architects of the common market expect the businesses in the region to flourish across borders. All five countries have already adopted a common external tariff, an identical tax applied to imports from outside the bloc, and allowed duty-free regional trade with the exception of Kenya, the largest economy. The EAC also has plans of floating a common currency within two years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India&#8217;s plan to create over $1bn sovereign-backed fund to boost trade and investment for domestic power utilities in South Asia will largely benefit Bhutan to fund its power distribution projects to its remote areas. Riding high on generating 45 percent of Bhutan’s revenues from exports of hydro energy to India, the country has earmarked $5mn for renewables from wind, solar and biogas, especially for families who live in remote areas.</p>
<p>Albeit the renewable power generation is relatively new to the mountainous south Asian country, it is upbeat about the commencement of the project by early next year. Mewang Gyeltshen, chief engineer from the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Bhutan told Recharge that energy demand was increasing by 12 percent, and country had sufficient supplies but remote households needed a sustainable standalone off-grid system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, India&#8217;s energy fund is aimed at developing a South Asian regional power grid, with focus on renewable sectors such as hydro, solar and wind. It will comprise of Bhutan with investment of about $850mn (3,000 MW), a 400-kv transmission line at $50mn with Nepal, a 1,000 MW HVDC link with Sri Lanka costing $415mn and a 1,000-MW HVDC back-to-back link with Bangladesh at $220mn.</p>
<p>It should be recalled the Tala Hydro power project in Bhutan, a joint venture by Indian firms, has been successfully commissioned in September 2006 and transmits power to North India. The project has mutually helped, Bhutan to jack up its economy while India to reduce power shortages in its northern parts.</p>
<p>The success of Tala has prompted other Indian energy firms to foray into Bhutan. Last month, the THDC India Ltd, a Govt. of India undertaking, has signed a MoU with Bhutan for the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of 180 MW Bunakha hydroelectric project in Bhutan. The Bunakha project is a part of the Indian government&#8217;s initiative to develop 10,000 MW of hydro power in Bhutan by the year 2020.</p>
<p>Bhutan sells hydropower to India at a price of $0.04 per kW, making 100 percent profit from a production cost of $0.02 per KW. Since it is estimated that for every one percent GDP growth more than the same percentage of energy production is required, Indo-Bhutan energy co-operation is likely to be a long-term one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Union President Herman Van Rompuy has made a whirlwind trip  to the Western Balkan states starting from Slovenia through Croatia,  Serbia and Kosovo to demonstrate the Union&#8217;s commitment for expansion.  The EU head&#8217;s visit to the countries that emerged after the sanguinary  break-up of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and Albania is  interpreted as EU’s special interest on the region in trying times.  Rompuy said on Monday &#8220;The Western Balkans region is a key priority for  EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Rompuy visited Croatia, he told that the country would  become the second state from the region to enter the EU after  Slovenia&#8217;s inclusion in 2004. Croatia&#8217;s entry to the EU seemed to be  likely soon as indicated in the words of the president, he said,  &#8220;Croatia&#8217;s joining the EU will give a positive signal to the region by  proving that the accession to the EU is attainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidentally,  Croatia&#8217;s EU accession negotiations started five years ago, and only  after Rompuy assumed office in December 2009 they gained some steam.  However, the Daily Delo, a leading Slovenian newspaper has questioned  the president&#8217;s earnestness of the integration of the region to the EU  zone.</p>
<p>On the contrary, while Rompuy visited Belgrade the Serbian  President Boris Tadic expressed dissatisfaction with the decelerated  process of the EU integration as he felt it was crucial for the future  of the West Balkans. The Serbian business community has often complained  about the problems they faced without the ticket to the EU despite they  produced low cost quality goods.</p>
<p>Rompuy reiterated that progress  in European integration primarily depended on each candidate&#8217;s own  merit and performance. Nonetheless, it has to be seen whether the merit  mantra would alone work as an expansion model to the EU as it may also  rely on solving the ongoing financial crisis which quaked the EU after  showing signs of recovery from the global meltdown.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hullabaloo over Jabulani, the official FIFA World Cup football may  help the failing exports of Pakistan if the soccer governing body opted  for Pakistan’s hand-stitched footballs over the Chinese thermally bonded  ones after the tournament. Last week, FIFA stated that it would start a  probe after acknowledging there was something wrong with the official  Adidas ball, pending actions post-tournament.</p>
<p>Many players have  likened the Jabulani to a &#8216;supermarket ball&#8217;, saying it is too  unpredictable and flies through the air too easily. Goalkeepers have  often expressed dissatisfaction about footballs at most mega events of  late, but this is the first time even field players and coaches joining  the chorus.</p>
<p>Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon went on to say “I  don&#8217;t see why we can&#8217;t just go back to the old black-and-white checkered  version we all played with as kids.” Statistics show scoring was down  by 16 goals in the first round as compared to last World Cup’s 117-101,  and scoring from set pieces has also witnessed significant dip.</p>
<p>According  to an APP report, Pakistan has exported around 3.5mn footballs worth  $5.2mn for the ongoing FIFA World Cup grabbing only 30 percent of the  total orders floated globally. The penetration of machine-made footballs  in the international market has caused a serious dent to Pakistan’s  hand-stitched soccer ball industry.</p>
<p>Footballs and other sports  goods are manufactured in Sialkot, a Pakistani province which boasts of  building an international airport with exporters’ fortune. Though  Sialkot was producing footballs since a century ago, it gained  international celebrity status when it produced the “Tango” ball for the  1982 World Cup in Spain, kicking off a lucrative industry.</p>
<p>The  footballs from Sialkot are subjected to daily tests of quality in  laboratories to supervise pressure, bounce, impermeability and shape.  The making of footballs include professional automatons cutting sheets  of synthetic leather in hexagons or pentagons, marking, drying the  paint, dividing the pieces and sewing with needles, thread and thimbles.</p>
<p>Only  a few years ago around 70 percent of world soccer balls were prepared  in Sialkot and the country on average was exporting 40mn balls worth  $210mn produced annually by some 60,000 highly skilled labourers.  Pakistan’s soccer ball industry is awaiting a huge favourable decision  from the FIFA for them to regain its coveted football exports share in  the global market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite a referendum for parliamentary democracy, the future of  Kyrgyzstan depends a lot on the foreign policy for the country by Russia  and the US. Russia along with the US backed the decision to go ahead  with the referendum from presidential to parliamentary form. However,  Russia disparaged on that idea soon after the result of the referendum  was out.</p>
<p>Both the US and Russia have military bases in Kyrgyzstan  and a stake in the country&#8217;s stability. The Russian President Dmitry  Medvedev, speaking to reporters after the recent G20 summit in Toronto,  voiced concern that a parliamentary system would make Kyrgyzstan  vulnerable to extremists.</p>
<p>But the unexpected criticism from  Russia, Kyrgyzstan’s closest ally may make the whole process of  referendum seem farcical. The two month period of a country, which  witnessed a bloodless coup d’état usurping an autocratic ruler, the  reinstatement of a new leader, the turbulence that followed and the  eventual referendum all indicate Kyrgyzstan’s stability will continue to  rely on the US-Russia ties.</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, southern  Kyrgyzstan has been plagued by ethnic clashes between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks.  The violence have left about 2000 dead, and more than 400,000 Uzbeks  were displaced and forced to flee from violent rampages to overcrowded  refugee camps in Uzbekistan. The allegedly Russia sponsored coup d’état  is believed to have set ablaze the volatile relations between the less  fortunate Kyrgyz majority and the generally rich Uzbek minority.</p>
<p>The  referendum is expected to usher in a parliamentary system of  governance, making Kyrgyzstan the first of Central Asia&#8217;s former Soviet  republics to shed a tradition of strong presidential rule. All of the  other Central Asian states &#8211; Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and  Uzbekistan &#8211; have presidential forms of government. Under the new  referendum, parliamentary elections will be held in October this year.</p>
<p>As  of now, Kyrgyzstan is in the middle of a tug of war between the US and  Russia to take direct or quasi control over the Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s Manas  international airport, the only prime location for transporting NATO  soldiers and supplies to Afghanistan. As both parties have interests  beyond strategic to prospecting trade opportunities in the country as  well as the region, the camaraderie seen during the G20 meet between  Obama and Medvedev only holds complete solution to the present crisis of  Kyrgyzstan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An initiative to make use of old rubber trees by a Canadian renewable  energy firm in Liberia is reaping rich dividends to the country’s  economy. The project is reported to have helped the farmers to get  cleared of the old trees and re-planted at no cost with guarantee of  money for the tree trunks.</p>
<p>Buchanan Renewables Power (BRP) began  commercial operations in Liberia two years ago with a complete  rejuvenation package for the non-producing rubber tree estates. The deal  for the farmers includes $2 per tonne of tree trunks, free of cost  re-plantation and for self-use or sale tree remnants which do not go  into the production of wood chips.</p>
<p>Liberia is estimated to have  more than 600,000ha of overgrown and moribund rubber farms. The new  model of rubber re-plantation rids of farmers’ laborious task of  re-claiming their estates by cutting down trees and re-planting them  spending money without revenues for a long period. After planting, the  trees take nearly seven years to start producing rubber.</p>
<p>Usually  rubber trees need to be replaced once they are over 25 years old, and  most of them in Liberia are between 30 and 60 years old. While helping  farmers, the new project will also provide electricity to communities in  the vicinity as well as has opened up exports to the woodchip markets  of Europe.</p>
<p>BRP uses massive diggers to uproot trees and a giant  mincer to produce rubber wood chips out of the trunks. The company has  exported 45,000MT of chips last year with contracts of about 90,000MT  for this year; and plans to clear 10,000ha annually.</p>
<p>The Buchanan  claims that it has the capacity to produce 400,000 tonnes of woodchips  per annum. Besides, on many farms, it has been able to plant two trees  for every one that has been harvested.</p>
<p>For Liberia it means that  many of its citizens will be re-injected to the market with jobs and  businesses, a dire need of the country that promises opportunities and  improved living standards after the end of seven years of civil war. BRP  says its vision is to achieve success in Liberia and repeat this model  in other countries in Africa and, to the extent possible, worldwide.</p>
<p>The  firm which emphasizes on cheap, environment-friendly and sustainable  energy production with a social commitment to Liberia is putting back  some of its revenues for power generation using the locally sourced wood  chips. However, the proposed 35MW power generation plant at Monrovia  which is supposed to provide electricity for half the price has not been  installed yet even two years after its approval.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent strikes at Honda and other factories in China for pay hike  have to be construed as the fallout of the dearth in obtaining  &#8216;qualified&#8217; workers and the rapidly changing mores of the Chinese  workforce. Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong provinces and other  provinces of China are facing severe shortage of qualified workers.</p>
<p>This  development has given rise to the market forces to flex its muscles in  pushing up wages, and eventually eating up the profit margins. In  addition, the narrowing of gap on the outlay of wages with other  competing markets has also reflected up on the product prices, which  have become higher as compared to other markets.</p>
<p>Surprisingly,  though the total labour force of China is about 800mn, very few workers  have the required qualifications. It should be recalled, C.P. Lee,  Asia-Pacific human resources chief at Motorola Inc. had observed “The  skills base does not meet the demands of a rapidly growing (Chinese)  market.”</p>
<p>In a rising wages scenario, the Chinese Companies  cannot survive in the global market without providing cheap products to  its clients, which was the core competency of most Chinese manufacturers  hitherto. With that, majority of the Chinese firms will be compelled to  shift from the earlier strategy of producing cheap products to quality  ones as the market for the cheap products may not exist in future. The  absence of cheap goods market will leave the Chinese companies with only  one option of leveraging through tapping the available ‘quality’ over a  quantity product market.</p>
<p>Hence, to grab new buyers whom seek  quality products, the manufacturing companies while dishing out higher  wages will also be forced to retain or recruit competent labour force to  produce superior quality products. The higher wages which trigger job  losses will equip the existing companies the liberty to choose the best  from the competitive labour market to cater to the new quality-preferred  clientele.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it goes without saying cheap labour  often adversely affects the efficiency of the workforce, and the China  growth story is an example to that premise. China’s strategy to garner  market share was always been associated with manufacturing more quantity  while often blowing to the wind the standards of quality.</p>
<p>So as  former chief Asia economist at Citigroup Inc., Huang Yiping’s  contention, China may be heading for the so-called Lewis turning point,  but the silver lining would be that the country would also be in the  process of becoming a “quality global factory”. Huang was referring to  the economic theory by the late Nobel Prize-winning economist W. Arthur  Lewis where manufacturing competitiveness and the pace of growth begin  to turn down as labour costs rise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Serbian businesspeople feel that though their country has opened  doors to the Croatian firms and products since 2000, the Serbian  companies are still not welcome in Croatia. According to a story  appeared in the Politika, a Belgrade daily and the oldest newspaper in  the Balkans, a Serbian fruit juice company owner is reported to have  observed that there were many obstacles for the Serbian businesses to be  successful in Croatia.</p>
<p>Slobodan Radun, the owner of Nectar, the  leading Serbian juice and soft drinks producer, told &#8220;Their (Croatian)  products have solid treatment here, their companies are buying ours, and  we do not have access to their market. We offer products of top quality  for lower prices than their producers, but it&#8217;s not working. Sometimes a  company with a special connection can do it, but it’s generally  impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Politika opined that though the government  agencies claimed the economic relations had improved, &#8220;not even the  contemporary trends and sacred international rules of market economy –  the free flow of goods and capital – are being respected&#8221;</p>
<p>According  to the data from the Croatian National Bank, the Croatian companies  invested in $641.7mn by the end of last year in Serbia, making Serbia  the second largest destination for the Croatian foreign investments. The  bilateral trade between both sides has increased manifold from $40mn in  2000 to $1bn in 2009. In the past seven years the trade has gone  against Serbia registering a trade deficit of $716.6mn, and Serbia is  one of the rare European countries with which Croatia has trade surplus.</p>
<p>It  should be noted that, in a recent conference, Economy Ministry State  Secretary Nebojsa Ciric admitted that only one Serbian investment was  able to succeed in Croatia, when the Swisslion Takovo bought the  Croatian Euro Food Market but otherwise most efforts bombed. It is yet  to be seen whether the last month’s accord between both nations to  remove political bottlenecks and simplifying business processes would  translate into equilibrized economic co-operation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the Gem &amp; Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC),  India&#8217;s polished diamond exports rose 73 percent year on year to almost  $1.8bn in May and the polished imports rose 68 percent during the same  period to $984mn for the month. The rough imports were up 55 percent in  May to $978mn; similarly, the rough exports rose 56 percent year over  year to $78mn, giving India net rough imports of $900mn, up from the  $541mn it posted in May 2009.</p>
<p>The available figures indicate that  the Indian diamond industry along with other major diamond trading  nations is gradually recovering from the shattering effects of global  economic crisis. Though the country was able to make some progress on  export front in the month of May, it is still significantly short of the  2008 level of $2.55bn in the same month on polished diamond exports.  Besides, India still has a polished export deficit of $864mn for the  first five months of 2010, up from the deficit of $430mn it posted a  year ago.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear whether India will be able to  put the past trade record on track as major procurement sources have  become susceptible to stiff competition. The latest developments in  Zimbabwe and China ties signal that the latter is making inroads in  obtaining diamond mining rights from some African countries including  the former, to nudge India from the African procurement zone.</p>
<p>China  is planning to augment its diamond polishing sector, which only  produced $3bn in exports in 2009 as compared to India&#8217;s $17.5bn. It  seems a fight is brewing between the world&#8217;s two fastest growing  economies, China and India, to lay claim over diamonds of Africa.</p>
<p>According  to sources, a deal has been struck between Zimbabwe and the Chinese  government to supply weapons in exchange for a steady supply of  diamonds. Moreover, some reports claim that Zimbabwe’s government is  secretly giving mining permits to soldiers of the Chinese military,  challenging the Kimberly Process, which promotes the mining and  production of conflict-free diamonds.</p>
