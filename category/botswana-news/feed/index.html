				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renewed confidence in the African economic renaissance, most international airlines are on an expansion mode in the African continent to meet the growing demands of a prospective travel and freight market. The stupendous rebound of Africa from the global economic mess, which devastated aviation industry the most, is regarded as the major reason for the industry to make Africa central to their business growth of late.</p>
<p>George Mawadri, British Airways&#8217; commercial manager in Kenya told the Business Daily that &#8220;There are great opportunities in Africa and we are eyeing the region keenly.&#8221; Likewise, Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank&#8217;s chief economist for Africa, had said in April, &#8220;Although Africa was the hardest hit by the crisis, its recovery has been so remarkable that we could be at the beginning of what history will describe as Africa’s decade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Major carriers such as Emirates, Qatar Airways, British Airways, Brussels, Lufthansa, Turkish Airline, Swiss International, and Delta have been introducing new African routes on their networks and increasing frequency to tap into the raising economic profile of Africa. In addition to the oversees airlines, domestic airlines like Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, South African Airways, Egypt Air and the Royal Air Morocco have been increasing their presence in the region and connecting their hubs to other international routes.</p>
<p>This July Belgian airline, Brussels, launched four new African destinations to its network — Ghana, Benin, Burkina Faso and Togo — and increased frequency to Ivory Coast. Emirates with 19 cities in its network and Qatar Airways with similar strong presence in the continent clearly indicate the Middle Eastern airlines will make at least many African cities as a stopover location to extend their airprint to other far-off international destinations.</p>
<p>Africa overcame the meltdown contrary to many forecasts including that of the World Bank, and it is estimated, at this pace of recovery, an economic growth of about 5 percent by the end of this year. Furthermore, in 2011, half of the world&#8217;s 10 fastest growing economies are expected to be in Africa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The three-day visit by the president of Botswana to Cuba has culminated  in the signing of several accords including healthcare, education,  sports and agriculture. The Botswanan President Seretse Khama Ian Khama  told that Cuba’s assistance to his country was enormous and decisive.  During his sojourn he met the Cuban President Raul Castro and many other  Cuban officials.</p>
<p>Botswana also signed a MoU to engage Cuban  medical personnel every two years with a clause not to re-employ them  after the completion of their service. Minister of Health, Dr John  Seakgosing who accompanied the President said that his country was  looking forward to Cuba&#8217;s new offering in the treatment of diabetes  through co-operation in providing medical care to its growing diabetic  population.</p>
<p>Botswana will also be seeking the Cuban know-how in  controlling vector menace through the use of biolarvicides chiefly to  mitigate debilitating diseases such as malaria, filariasis and  Onchocerciasis. Some studies have indicated the vector-spread diseases  had seriously impacted the progress of the African countries by lowering  productivity through prolonged sicknesses to their working citizens or  their relatives.</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, the Foreign Minister of  Botswana, Phadu Skelernani termed the US embargo against Cuba as  &#8220;unnecessary&#8221;, and appealed for revocation of the sanctions. He was  maintaining the rhetoric of his president, who said on the first day of  his visit, &#8220;Sometimes, in Africa, we receive millions of dollars from  rich countries. However, proportionally speaking, Cuba gives us a lot  more than anybody else&#8221;.</p>
<p>Skelernani and the Cuban Deputy Foreign  Minister Marcelino Medina signed agreement on co-operation and  Seakgosing and his Cuban counterpart, Jose Ramon Balaguer signed pact on  development of a comprehensive health care system. The trip to Cuba is  the Botswanan President&#8217;s second one, the last time he visited the  island was in 2007 as the Vice-President of his country.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Obama administration has categorically stated that they had no interest to move forward with the free trade negotiations with the five-member Southern African Custom Union (SACU) due to the failure of several rounds of talks. The SACU comprises of South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, and the negotiations with the US began in 2003. In 2006, the talks were suspended allegedly due to the US’ unrealistic demands that could not be implemented in the SACU states.</p>
<p>The US Trade Representative Ron Kirk revealed about the stalemate on the FTA at the sidelines of the inauguration ceremony of the Jacob Zuma presidency. However, he claimed there was still room for growth as South Africa was by far the largest beneficiary of trade under Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). He later added that it was possible to think of a new start with the new government at the helm since the US had very good foundation in South Africa with over 600 US business investments in various sectors.</p>
<p>Even though the central reason for the disinterest is not spelled out by the US authorities, the possibilities to this action seemed to be the same old ones. The old demand of the US particularly the intellectual property rights, and protectionist strategy could have checkmated the deal as of now.</p>
<p>South Africa is one of the SACU members that has largely benefitted by the Generalised System of Preferences that allows certain products to enter the US duty-free. South African clothing and selected textile products have duty-free access to the US market through the AGOA, an initiative of the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Trade and Industry of South Africa, the US is the largest market for its merchandise. On the other hand, South Africa’s third largest imports are from the US.</p>
<p>South Africa’s trade analyst Peter Draper admitted that the US government’s move did not come as a surprise “for a number of reasons”. In his opinion, the failure to clinch FTA with the US is a huge blow to SACU.</p>
