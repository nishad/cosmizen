				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wraith of global meltdown is still resonating in some form or the other in most outsourcing dependent countries. The recent Cambodia garment workers’ strike turns out to be a perfect case in point to the premise.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Cambodian police with riot gears thwarted a week-long strike sparked off by the suspension of a union official at a Malaysian-owned garment factory, which produced goods for international brands including Gap, Benetton, Adidas and Puma. It has been reported that the clashes between more than 100 armed police force and 3,000 garment workers in Phnom Penh had resulted in nine women being hurt, though authorities maintain the operations did not hurt anyone.</p>
<p>The BBC&#8217;s Guy De Launey in Phnom Penh says the unrest could be a symptom of a wider social malaise owing to dwindling orders in Cambodia&#8217;s crucial garment industry which resulted in tens of thousands of job losses. Early this month, government increased the minimum wage from about $50 to $60, but the double-digit inflation and the trade unions demands of above $80 seemed to be bogging down the effect.</p>
<p>Albeit the unions retracted from a three-day general strike in protest against the meagre rise, the union official’s suspension is believed to have aggravated the situation. But last week’s Huffington Post report interpreted these strikes as a knee-jerk reaction to irrational calibration of wages by the outsourcing firms or associated agencies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in last week’s blog by Auret van Heerden, President and CEO of the Fair Labour Association visualizes firms that build strong Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes into their operations and culture would have the edge in many markets. Nevertheless, evidences show such practices by firms are beyond procurement principles as it solely reckons pricing and related aspects devoid of labour rights &#8211; especially post-meltdown.</p>
<p>Cambodia’s textile industry accounts for around 85 percent of exports, and is the country’s third-largest source of income after tourism and agriculture. The Southeast Asian state continues to be in the grip of labour problems particularly after the global economic crisis that bombed exports severely to create an economic landscape of joblessness &#8211; and desertion of production units by the employers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was always a mystery why most military powers constantly attempted to  occupy often portrayed derelict Afghanistan, but with the latest  discovery of the country being seated over more than $1tn precious  mineral deposits lays it to rest instantly. According to The New York  Times, the vast scale of Afghanistan&#8217;s mineral wealth was discovered by a  small team of Pentagon officials and American geologists.</p>
<p>Interestingly,  an internal Pentagon memo, states that Afghanistan could become the  “Saudi Arabia of lithium,” a key raw material in the manufacture of  batteries for laptops and mobile phones. It also reports that the  country is home to previously unknown deposits — including huge veins of  iron, copper, cobalt, gold and large deposits of niobium, a soft metal  used in producing superconducting steel, besides lithium.</p>
<p>The  memo compels to probe, what is Pentagon’s task in Afghanistan? Is it  mining, peace-keeping or capturing the elusive terrorists? The timing of  the announcement also induces the misgivings on the veracity of the  study as well as the US interest in the country.  Is the US trying to  stay longer in Afghanistan on this pretext to thwart the increasing  presence of the regional powers, China and India, by providing business  options to the county?</p>
<p>In November, a 30-year lease, to start  mining copper in the Aynak valley, southwest of Kabul, which holds one  of the world’s biggest untapped copper deposits, was sold to the China  Metallurgical Group for $3bn, making it the biggest foreign investment  and private business venture in Afghanistan’s history. Likewise,  post-Taliban, India is also heavily involved in the re-construction and  development of Afghanistan’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>The retrospective  chronicling of the events on the recent discovery compel to call for  more queries. Why Russia did not show much interest in Afghanistan  despite having the cognizance of country’s rare mineral wealth?</p>
<p>According  to the study, while leaving Afghanistan in 1989 after nearly a  decade-old occupation the Soviets left behind a horde of old charts and  data hinting on the massive mineral deposits in the country.  Incidentally, it says, it was with these data, the US Geological Survey  began a series of aerial surveys of Afghanistan’s mineral resources in  2006.</p>
<p>Consequently, it establishes a fact that the US entered  Afghanistan with prior knowledge of potential mineral wealth in the  country.  If there is truth in the find, then the Afghanistan’s new  found fortune fuels the perception that any ‘offensive’ war includes an  exploration agenda for natural resources or knowledge treasure trove  behind it whenever any country initiates a war in a foreign land,  especially a far-off one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uganda&#8217;s latest offering of the new National Development Plan (NDP) is looked upon by its citizenry with lot of hope as well as misgivings. The failures of past experiments to perk up the economy are forcing people of the country and analysts alike not to categorically accept it as an effective plan, but a pre-poll promise.</p>
<p>The new plan, which would be supplanting the bombed &#8220;Vision 2025&#8243; has been largely blamed for its timing as elections less than a year away neither allows to check the efficacy of the program nor could be implemented to any degree. The NDP is expected to transform Uganda from a peasant to a prosperous country within the next 30 years with emphasis on agriculture, infrastructural development and food security.</p>
<p>The failure for &#8220;Vision 2025&#8243;, launched in 1999, is cited as lack of funds and absence of constitutionally mandated body, such as National Planning Authority (NPA) who drafted the NDP, to coordinate it. Though repeated failures of several plans haunt the Ugandan psyche, experts believe that this one would materialize particularly as the Ugandan economy is better placed than it was 10 years ago, and since the economic growth would be further boosted by oil profits.</p>
<p>The NDP fundamentally departs from the failed Structural Adjustment Policies (SAPs) which was initiated in the late 1980&#8242;s with the recommendation from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Under SAPs, the government sold most of the state-owned enterprises to the private sector including co-operative banks which supported agriculture sector that employed 73 percent.</p>
<p>SAPs literally brought the Ugandan economy to a standstill with no progress in infrastructure and other spheres those required constant care. Nonetheless, the NDP that advises a conversion from market economy to a quasi- market economy will be more of public-private partnership than government becoming a namesake watchdog of the economy.</p>
<p>During the recent launch of the new plan, the President of Uganda Yoweri Museveni presented evidence as to how these milestones would be achieved. He observed the projected oil earnings and tax revenues would suffice for tiding over fiscal deficits and developmental plan implementation.</p>
