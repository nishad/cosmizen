				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Swiss President Doris Leuthard&#8217;s week-long visit to China is likely to make Switzerland once again a first mover from Europe to sign an FTA with China as it had established diplomatic ties 60 years ago. The Swiss Embassy to China apprised Global Times that the FTA talks were officially launched.</p>
<p>Leuthard, who ended a six-day working visit to China on Sunday, had said that the feasibility study which began in 2009 had covered all potential areas of trade. Sun Xiaolan, assistant to the Commerce Department of the Swiss Embassy to China said on Monday the FTA talks had officially kicked off.</p>
<p>Although Sun did not disclose the detail of the initial talks but confirmed that Switzerland would soon be the first European country to conclude an FTA with China, as it was with Japan in 2009. Switzerland has the distinction of becoming one of the first Western countries to establish diplomatic relations with China, today to transform itself into a major trading partner from the region.</p>
<p>The top Chinese legislator Wu Bangguo, while he met Leuthard had said the two nations could explore new ways to better combine Swiss technology with the Chinese market. Similarly, the Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said the country had &#8216;enormous demand&#8217; for Swiss products relating to environmental protection, energy conservation and emissions reduction.</p>
<p>Switzerland is China&#8217;s ninth largest European trade partner, while China is Switzerland&#8217;s fourth largest global trade partner. In the first half of this year, bilateral trade jumped 127 percent, and China&#8217;s imports from Switzerland increased 180 percent compared to the same time last year.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Commerce, bilateral trade between China and Switzerland topped $11.3bn in 2008, and slightly dropped to $10.18bn in 2009, with $5.28bn of Swiss exports and $4.9bn imports from China.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent sanctions against Iran hammered out by the US and like-minded countries targeting energy and banking sectors have become more blatantly farcical when China resumed oil trade with Iran even after the embargo came into effect. Desperate moves by Tehran to forge ties with China, the second largest oil consumer, indicate that the latter would be in a position to fish in troubled waters in the absence of competition from energy-starved nations following sanctions.</p>
<p>Iran&#8217;s Oil Minister Massoud Mirkazemi met the Chinese vice Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing last week, and agreed on enhancing relations between the two nations, especially in the oil and gas sector. Li Keqiang is reported to have told the visiting Iranian oil minister that Beijing would maintain co-operation with Tehran on existing projects.</p>
<p>It should be recalled that last month, the Deputy Oil Minister Hossein Noghrekar Shirazi told the state-run Mehr news agency the Chinese companies were already involved in energy exploration and production projects in Iran worth about $29bn, and in refining and related activities at about $10bn.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some reports say that even Russia is not far behind China in cashing in on Iran embargo. Rajab Safarov, head of the Iran Commission of the Moscow Chamber of Commerce and Industry informed Russian companies were discussing &#8220;serious deliveries&#8221; to Iran in late August or September.</p>
<p>The US and the EU had made repeated requests to China and Russia to comprehensively honor sanctions against Iran. However, despite approval to sanctions both countries have differences on the scale of punitive measures slapped on nuclear interests of Iran.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sanctions are not considered an effective tool&#8230; and they will only complicate the situation&#8221; was the reaction from foreign ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast last month as quoted by the state news agency IRNA. Likewise, Mirkazemi has also told at that point &#8220;European oil companies has no presence (in Iran&#8217;s energy sector) and so they cannot have any impact on us&#8221;, in a response to the EU&#8217;s recent oil sanctions.</p>
<p>If China and Russia continue trade with Iran, sanctions not only become meaningless but also jeopardize business prospects of other countries, including that of India which has massive ongoing and some in the pipeline oil trade deals with Iran. Bloomberg reported sanctions were forcing refiners such as India&#8217;s Reliance Industries to pay higher costs to ship gasoline to more distant markets. According to Simpson, Spence &amp; Young Ltd., the world&#8217;s second-largest shipbroker, India to the US shipping costs, at $1.9mn, are almost five times higher than those to the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s boom time for Russian and Chinese oil traders,&#8221; said Michael Swangard, a London-based international trade lawyer at Clyde &amp; Co., which counts BP and Lloyds of London among its clients. It&#8217;s &#8220;practically impossible&#8221; for Europeans to buy Iran&#8217;s oil or sell it, he said.</p>
<p>According to Chinese customs data, in the first half of 2010, Iran held its place as China&#8217;s third biggest supplier of crude with shipments of 9mn tons of oil, putting it behind Saudi Arabia and Angola.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nationals&#8217; leader Warren Truss revealed that a Coalition government at the centre would restore funding to exporters and appoint an ambassador for trade reforms and specialist trade representatives for Australia&#8217;s manufacturing and service Industries. An Abbott government would increase the EMDG cap to AUD 200mn from July 1, 2011, restoring an AUD $50mn shortfall caused by Labour government mismanagement, he added.</p>
<p>Truss&#8217; announcement gains prominence following a recent pre-poll survey gave a slight edge for the Coalition to form the next government of Australia. An opinion poll of Newspoll, a market research firm, commissioned by The Australian newspaper has found that the opposition Liberals leading 52 percent to 48 percent over the ruling Labour.</p>
<p>Truss was echoing similar trade plans which the Australian Opposition Leader Tony Abbott announced on Monday for the tourism industry of the country. Abbot declared a Coalition government would spend an extra AUD $90mn (US$82mn) to help attract visitors to Australia.</p>
<p>The tourism package includes an AUD $40mn (US$36mn) fund that would provide grants of up to AUD $100,000 to build infrastructure for tourism projects.</p>
<p>Another AUD $14mn fund would provide grants to tourism organizations in regional areas. Tourism Research Australia will also be provided with AUD $8mn to identify emerging trends and gaps in the market, to make the industry to become more sustainable.</p>
<p>The Coalition sees tourism a niche business to Australia as the industry employs close to 500,000 people and earns AUD $24bn in export earnings. The Opposition has also allocated AUD $27mn for Regional Medical Workforce Plan to increase the number of doctors, nurses and dentists in regional and remote areas of Australia.</p>
<p>Truss said the Coalition would appoint an ambassador for trade reform to promote global trade reform and re-establish the Trade Advisory Council abolished by the Labour. He clarified that the Coalition&#8217;s highest trade priority would be the Doha round of negotiations towards freer world trade, but it would vigorously pursue FTA with China, Japan, Malaysia, the GCC, South Korea and Indonesia.</p>
<p>All details on future plans for trade and industry by the Opposition were laid out during the election campaigns, and were loaded with the Ruling&#8217;s inefficiencies and inequities. Australia&#8217;s general elections will be held on 21 of this month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey will join an economic bloc comprising of the Middle Eastern states such as Syria, Lebanon and Jordan ahead of the protracted accession to the EU. Last weekend, the four nations jointly agreed to follow up on creating a free trade zone to boost trade exchanges particularly to support SMEs of respective countries by eliminating trade barriers.</p>
<p>The Turkish Foreign Trade Minister Zafer Çaglayan hosted the meeting, and was attended by the Syrian Economy and Trade Minister Lamia Assi, the Jordanian Minister of Industry and Trade Amir al-Hadidi and the Lebanese Economy and Trade Minister Mohammad Safadi. The meet decided to form a committee, the Close Neighbors Economic and Trade Partnership Council (CNETAC) to further its cause.</p>
<p>The committee will work on to sketch a roadmap to determine priorities regarding areas of co-operation, and will hold its first meeting in September in Amman, Jordan. The meet further informed that a follow-up of the CNETAC ministerial meeting would be held in the Syrian capital of Damascus in December.</p>
<p>Çaglayan apprised that the goal of the bloc would be to increase and diversify trade and investments among the four countries by creating a liberal trade and investment environment with a modern infrastructure at the international level, free from all tariff and non-tariff barriers, encompassed by a geography which fed a population of 105mn and, as of 2009, had a combined GDP of $723bn, imports amounted to $176bn and exports to $131bn.</p>
<p>In response, Lamia Assi said a Syrian market worth $300bn was awaiting Turkey, and the country could achieve a 40 percent advantage in trade with other Arab countries including Saudi Arabia by sending goods via Syria as her state enjoyed customs-free with Arab nations due to the Arab Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>According to the Turkish Trade Minister, the bilateral trade between Turkey and Syria is $795mn three years ago, but is $1.8bn by 2009.</p>
<p>Turkey&#8217;s proximity to the Middle Eastern countries has had invited criticisms from some quarters that the country was shifting its axis by turning away from the West and gradually becoming more of a Middle Eastern state. Çaglayan rebutted the argument by saying that Turkey&#8217;s axis was with the world but not region-centric.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wraith of global meltdown is still resonating in some form or the other in most outsourcing dependent countries. The recent Cambodia garment workers’ strike turns out to be a perfect case in point to the premise.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Cambodian police with riot gears thwarted a week-long strike sparked off by the suspension of a union official at a Malaysian-owned garment factory, which produced goods for international brands including Gap, Benetton, Adidas and Puma. It has been reported that the clashes between more than 100 armed police force and 3,000 garment workers in Phnom Penh had resulted in nine women being hurt, though authorities maintain the operations did not hurt anyone.</p>
<p>The BBC&#8217;s Guy De Launey in Phnom Penh says the unrest could be a symptom of a wider social malaise owing to dwindling orders in Cambodia&#8217;s crucial garment industry which resulted in tens of thousands of job losses. Early this month, government increased the minimum wage from about $50 to $60, but the double-digit inflation and the trade unions demands of above $80 seemed to be bogging down the effect.</p>
<p>Albeit the unions retracted from a three-day general strike in protest against the meagre rise, the union official’s suspension is believed to have aggravated the situation. But last week’s Huffington Post report interpreted these strikes as a knee-jerk reaction to irrational calibration of wages by the outsourcing firms or associated agencies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in last week’s blog by Auret van Heerden, President and CEO of the Fair Labour Association visualizes firms that build strong Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes into their operations and culture would have the edge in many markets. Nevertheless, evidences show such practices by firms are beyond procurement principles as it solely reckons pricing and related aspects devoid of labour rights &#8211; especially post-meltdown.</p>
<p>Cambodia’s textile industry accounts for around 85 percent of exports, and is the country’s third-largest source of income after tourism and agriculture. The Southeast Asian state continues to be in the grip of labour problems particularly after the global economic crisis that bombed exports severely to create an economic landscape of joblessness &#8211; and desertion of production units by the employers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TransFair USA, a non-profit organization and a third-party certifier of Fair Trade (FT) products in the US has now launched FT-labelled vodka which ensures farmers from Bolivia to fetch commensurate earnings for their produce. The organization has added on Fair Vodka of Fair Trade Spirits Company into its kitty to fulfil its goal of including almost everything which is produced through sustainable methods that provide equal benefits to everyone and everything involved in the whole cycle of supply chain.</p>
<p>After being in the market for more than a decade, TransFair today has in excess of 6,000 FT products available in 105 product categories including wine, fruit, chocolate, rice, flowers and garments. To San Francisco Chronicle Paul Rice, TransFair USA&#8217;s founder and CEO told he was inspired by the success of FT coffee in Europe and decided to organize a co-op of small coffee farmers in Nicaragua several years ago.</p>
<p>Rice informed during the inception, his co-op could gather the trust of just 24 &#8220;brave souls&#8221; who each gave it 10 bags of coffee on consignment. It sold for $1.26 per pound, and $1 went to the farmers, who were used to receiving only 10 cents per pound. His co-op comprises of about 3000 farmers today.</p>
<p>Jean-Francois Daniel, co-founder of the 2-year-old Fair Trade Spirits Company based in Paris who has similar background and experience like that of Rice said his distillery made Fair Vodka from quinoa, a grain grown by an association of 1,200 small, TransFair-certified farmers in the Bolivian Highlands. He claimed the daily wage for a non- FT quinoa farmer in Bolivia was $1 per day, but the FT quinoa farmers which his company worked with earned $2.80 per day.</p>
<p>Currently, the vodka is available at some stores and restaurants in California. Amanda Womack the general manager of Cask, the first San Francisco retailer to sell Fair Vodka acknowledged even at $35 per bottle, Fair was one of the less-expensive vodkas Cask sold through its store and website.</p>
<p>According to TransFair, the offering of spirits will not be confined to vodka but also will be coming out with berry and coffee liqueur and rum as well. Fair Goji, a goji berry liqueur made with FT sugar from the African nation of Malawi and Fair Café, a coffee liqueur made with FT coffee from Mexico are likely to hit the markets soon for consumers to give spiritual contribution to FT programs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A high profile delegation headed by the Prime Minister of Kuwait Sheikh Nasser Al Mohammed will begin its tour of South America on Wednesday. The three-week trip to nine countries including Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico will attempt to explore investment opportunities in these countries, and also to attract investments to Kuwait from the region.</p>
<p>As mentioned by the Kuwaiti premier before the trip that the country had not undertaken a high-level international trip like this in recent past is primarily aimed at leveraging the KD 37bn ($125bn) which the government has set aside for the five-year development plan of Kuwait. Furthermore, Kuwait desires to showcase the region and the world as well its &#8220;resilience&#8221; to the Iraqi invasion and occupation in 1990.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Kuwait News Agency (KUNA), Ali Al Sammak, who serves as the Kuwait&#8217;s Ambassador to Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Canada and Ambassador Designate to Mexico said the Premier was &#8220;very keen&#8221; on opening embassies in more South American countries. According to a KUNA report, Kuwait is looking to open new embassies in Cuba, Mexico and Chile to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties with most nations in South America.</p>
<p>Al Sammak further added that though Kuwaiti relations with South America was good yet in the fields of education, economy, healthcare, investment, and industry required a lot of effort to exact right results. The high level Kuwaiti team includes the ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Commerce and Industry as well as officials from the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI).</p>
<p>The out-stretched tour is expected to see the signing of a series of co-operation agreements covering trade partnerships and other areas of interests between Kuwait and the touring nations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India&#8217;s plan to create over $1bn sovereign-backed fund to boost trade and investment for domestic power utilities in South Asia will largely benefit Bhutan to fund its power distribution projects to its remote areas. Riding high on generating 45 percent of Bhutan’s revenues from exports of hydro energy to India, the country has earmarked $5mn for renewables from wind, solar and biogas, especially for families who live in remote areas.</p>
<p>Albeit the renewable power generation is relatively new to the mountainous south Asian country, it is upbeat about the commencement of the project by early next year. Mewang Gyeltshen, chief engineer from the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Bhutan told Recharge that energy demand was increasing by 12 percent, and country had sufficient supplies but remote households needed a sustainable standalone off-grid system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, India&#8217;s energy fund is aimed at developing a South Asian regional power grid, with focus on renewable sectors such as hydro, solar and wind. It will comprise of Bhutan with investment of about $850mn (3,000 MW), a 400-kv transmission line at $50mn with Nepal, a 1,000 MW HVDC link with Sri Lanka costing $415mn and a 1,000-MW HVDC back-to-back link with Bangladesh at $220mn.</p>
<p>It should be recalled the Tala Hydro power project in Bhutan, a joint venture by Indian firms, has been successfully commissioned in September 2006 and transmits power to North India. The project has mutually helped, Bhutan to jack up its economy while India to reduce power shortages in its northern parts.</p>
<p>The success of Tala has prompted other Indian energy firms to foray into Bhutan. Last month, the THDC India Ltd, a Govt. of India undertaking, has signed a MoU with Bhutan for the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of 180 MW Bunakha hydroelectric project in Bhutan. The Bunakha project is a part of the Indian government&#8217;s initiative to develop 10,000 MW of hydro power in Bhutan by the year 2020.</p>
<p>Bhutan sells hydropower to India at a price of $0.04 per kW, making 100 percent profit from a production cost of $0.02 per KW. Since it is estimated that for every one percent GDP growth more than the same percentage of energy production is required, Indo-Bhutan energy co-operation is likely to be a long-term one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Union President Herman Van Rompuy has made a whirlwind trip  to the Western Balkan states starting from Slovenia through Croatia,  Serbia and Kosovo to demonstrate the Union&#8217;s commitment for expansion.  The EU head&#8217;s visit to the countries that emerged after the sanguinary  break-up of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and Albania is  interpreted as EU’s special interest on the region in trying times.  Rompuy said on Monday &#8220;The Western Balkans region is a key priority for  EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Rompuy visited Croatia, he told that the country would  become the second state from the region to enter the EU after  Slovenia&#8217;s inclusion in 2004. Croatia&#8217;s entry to the EU seemed to be  likely soon as indicated in the words of the president, he said,  &#8220;Croatia&#8217;s joining the EU will give a positive signal to the region by  proving that the accession to the EU is attainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidentally,  Croatia&#8217;s EU accession negotiations started five years ago, and only  after Rompuy assumed office in December 2009 they gained some steam.  However, the Daily Delo, a leading Slovenian newspaper has questioned  the president&#8217;s earnestness of the integration of the region to the EU  zone.</p>
<p>On the contrary, while Rompuy visited Belgrade the Serbian  President Boris Tadic expressed dissatisfaction with the decelerated  process of the EU integration as he felt it was crucial for the future  of the West Balkans. The Serbian business community has often complained  about the problems they faced without the ticket to the EU despite they  produced low cost quality goods.</p>
<p>Rompuy reiterated that progress  in European integration primarily depended on each candidate&#8217;s own  merit and performance. Nonetheless, it has to be seen whether the merit  mantra would alone work as an expansion model to the EU as it may also  rely on solving the ongoing financial crisis which quaked the EU after  showing signs of recovery from the global meltdown.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite a referendum for parliamentary democracy, the future of  Kyrgyzstan depends a lot on the foreign policy for the country by Russia  and the US. Russia along with the US backed the decision to go ahead  with the referendum from presidential to parliamentary form. However,  Russia disparaged on that idea soon after the result of the referendum  was out.</p>
<p>Both the US and Russia have military bases in Kyrgyzstan  and a stake in the country&#8217;s stability. The Russian President Dmitry  Medvedev, speaking to reporters after the recent G20 summit in Toronto,  voiced concern that a parliamentary system would make Kyrgyzstan  vulnerable to extremists.</p>
<p>But the unexpected criticism from  Russia, Kyrgyzstan’s closest ally may make the whole process of  referendum seem farcical. The two month period of a country, which  witnessed a bloodless coup d’état usurping an autocratic ruler, the  reinstatement of a new leader, the turbulence that followed and the  eventual referendum all indicate Kyrgyzstan’s stability will continue to  rely on the US-Russia ties.</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, southern  Kyrgyzstan has been plagued by ethnic clashes between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks.  The violence have left about 2000 dead, and more than 400,000 Uzbeks  were displaced and forced to flee from violent rampages to overcrowded  refugee camps in Uzbekistan. The allegedly Russia sponsored coup d’état  is believed to have set ablaze the volatile relations between the less  fortunate Kyrgyz majority and the generally rich Uzbek minority.</p>
<p>The  referendum is expected to usher in a parliamentary system of  governance, making Kyrgyzstan the first of Central Asia&#8217;s former Soviet  republics to shed a tradition of strong presidential rule. All of the  other Central Asian states &#8211; Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and  Uzbekistan &#8211; have presidential forms of government. Under the new  referendum, parliamentary elections will be held in October this year.</p>
<p>As  of now, Kyrgyzstan is in the middle of a tug of war between the US and  Russia to take direct or quasi control over the Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s Manas  international airport, the only prime location for transporting NATO  soldiers and supplies to Afghanistan. As both parties have interests  beyond strategic to prospecting trade opportunities in the country as  well as the region, the camaraderie seen during the G20 meet between  Obama and Medvedev only holds complete solution to the present crisis of  Kyrgyzstan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An initiative to make use of old rubber trees by a Canadian renewable  energy firm in Liberia is reaping rich dividends to the country’s  economy. The project is reported to have helped the farmers to get  cleared of the old trees and re-planted at no cost with guarantee of  money for the tree trunks.</p>
<p>Buchanan Renewables Power (BRP) began  commercial operations in Liberia two years ago with a complete  rejuvenation package for the non-producing rubber tree estates. The deal  for the farmers includes $2 per tonne of tree trunks, free of cost  re-plantation and for self-use or sale tree remnants which do not go  into the production of wood chips.</p>
<p>Liberia is estimated to have  more than 600,000ha of overgrown and moribund rubber farms. The new  model of rubber re-plantation rids of farmers’ laborious task of  re-claiming their estates by cutting down trees and re-planting them  spending money without revenues for a long period. After planting, the  trees take nearly seven years to start producing rubber.</p>
<p>Usually  rubber trees need to be replaced once they are over 25 years old, and  most of them in Liberia are between 30 and 60 years old. While helping  farmers, the new project will also provide electricity to communities in  the vicinity as well as has opened up exports to the woodchip markets  of Europe.</p>
<p>BRP uses massive diggers to uproot trees and a giant  mincer to produce rubber wood chips out of the trunks. The company has  exported 45,000MT of chips last year with contracts of about 90,000MT  for this year; and plans to clear 10,000ha annually.</p>
<p>The Buchanan  claims that it has the capacity to produce 400,000 tonnes of woodchips  per annum. Besides, on many farms, it has been able to plant two trees  for every one that has been harvested.</p>
<p>For Liberia it means that  many of its citizens will be re-injected to the market with jobs and  businesses, a dire need of the country that promises opportunities and  improved living standards after the end of seven years of civil war. BRP  says its vision is to achieve success in Liberia and repeat this model  in other countries in Africa and, to the extent possible, worldwide.</p>
<p>The  firm which emphasizes on cheap, environment-friendly and sustainable  energy production with a social commitment to Liberia is putting back  some of its revenues for power generation using the locally sourced wood  chips. However, the proposed 35MW power generation plant at Monrovia  which is supposed to provide electricity for half the price has not been  installed yet even two years after its approval.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ubiquitous plastic bottles, a serious menace to nature is becoming a  key raw material in building houses for the low income families of  Latin America. The brain behind this project is understood to have drawn  inspiration from a need of a little girl who dreamt of having an  independent room as she shared one single room with five others.</p>
<p>According  to the Efe, the leading Spanish language news agency, the project  called “Casas de Botellas” (Houses of Bottles) is the brainchild of  Ingrid Vaca Díaz from Bolivia. The ‘green’ houses which Ingrid has been  promoting for the last seven years are believed to have natural  temperature-control capabilities.</p>
<p>A cluster of glass and plastic  bottles of 600ml, one and two litres interlaced with honey, sand,  debris, linseed oil and milk have gone into the making of these low-cost  homes. Ingrid told “Casas de Botellas is a group effort in which the  poorest families, with a helping hand from their friends, relatives,  neighbours and volunteer workers, learn to construct their own houses  and give themselves and their families a decent place to live.”</p>
<p>The  project began in Warnes, her hometown, when a little girl called  Claudia told her that for a Christmas present she dreamt of a bedroom of  her own, since in her 4-square-meter (43sq.ft.) dwelling she shared a  bed with five other people.</p>
<p>Vaca said earlier she used to store  the bottles for making handicrafts and chairs; and while her husband  informed that he had plans of disposing them off she overheard Claudia’s  dream, and conceived a home out of these bottles. The house that Ingrid  built in collaboration with Claudia’s family, people of the community  and volunteers went from 43 to 1,827sq.ft, and made use of 36,000  two-litre plastic bottles.</p>
<p>The standard is to use for each meter  approximately 81 bottles stuffed with throwaway material like paper,  plastic bags, batteries, sand and dirt to build the walls of the house.  The bottles are stuck together with bricks, lime and cement, and are  held with a kind of webbing to make completely sure the construction  will be permanent.</p>
<p>Other materials such as rods, roofing tiles,  bricks, gravel, window panes, ceramic tiles, wooden frames and  accessories for bathrooms and kitchens are donated by companies,  individuals and institutions. The finishing touch for the houses is a  coat of paint in which the colours of the columns contrast with the  walls, and the bottoms of the bottles remain subtly visible and are  painted in the form of flowers.</p>
<p>Until now Casas de Botellas has  built six homes in Bolivia, one in Argentina and two in Uruguay and  Mexico. Twenty more houses are planned to be built in Argentina, and the  project is expected to continue collaborating with other communities  throughout Latin America.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent strikes at Honda and other factories in China for pay hike  have to be construed as the fallout of the dearth in obtaining  &#8216;qualified&#8217; workers and the rapidly changing mores of the Chinese  workforce. Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong provinces and other  provinces of China are facing severe shortage of qualified workers.</p>
<p>This  development has given rise to the market forces to flex its muscles in  pushing up wages, and eventually eating up the profit margins. In  addition, the narrowing of gap on the outlay of wages with other  competing markets has also reflected up on the product prices, which  have become higher as compared to other markets.</p>
<p>Surprisingly,  though the total labour force of China is about 800mn, very few workers  have the required qualifications. It should be recalled, C.P. Lee,  Asia-Pacific human resources chief at Motorola Inc. had observed “The  skills base does not meet the demands of a rapidly growing (Chinese)  market.”</p>
<p>In a rising wages scenario, the Chinese Companies  cannot survive in the global market without providing cheap products to  its clients, which was the core competency of most Chinese manufacturers  hitherto. With that, majority of the Chinese firms will be compelled to  shift from the earlier strategy of producing cheap products to quality  ones as the market for the cheap products may not exist in future. The  absence of cheap goods market will leave the Chinese companies with only  one option of leveraging through tapping the available ‘quality’ over a  quantity product market.</p>
<p>Hence, to grab new buyers whom seek  quality products, the manufacturing companies while dishing out higher  wages will also be forced to retain or recruit competent labour force to  produce superior quality products. The higher wages which trigger job  losses will equip the existing companies the liberty to choose the best  from the competitive labour market to cater to the new quality-preferred  clientele.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it goes without saying cheap labour  often adversely affects the efficiency of the workforce, and the China  growth story is an example to that premise. China’s strategy to garner  market share was always been associated with manufacturing more quantity  while often blowing to the wind the standards of quality.</p>
<p>So as  former chief Asia economist at Citigroup Inc., Huang Yiping’s  contention, China may be heading for the so-called Lewis turning point,  but the silver lining would be that the country would also be in the  process of becoming a “quality global factory”. Huang was referring to  the economic theory by the late Nobel Prize-winning economist W. Arthur  Lewis where manufacturing competitiveness and the pace of growth begin  to turn down as labour costs rise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Serbian businesspeople feel that though their country has opened  doors to the Croatian firms and products since 2000, the Serbian  companies are still not welcome in Croatia. According to a story  appeared in the Politika, a Belgrade daily and the oldest newspaper in  the Balkans, a Serbian fruit juice company owner is reported to have  observed that there were many obstacles for the Serbian businesses to be  successful in Croatia.</p>
<p>Slobodan Radun, the owner of Nectar, the  leading Serbian juice and soft drinks producer, told &#8220;Their (Croatian)  products have solid treatment here, their companies are buying ours, and  we do not have access to their market. We offer products of top quality  for lower prices than their producers, but it&#8217;s not working. Sometimes a  company with a special connection can do it, but it’s generally  impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Politika opined that though the government  agencies claimed the economic relations had improved, &#8220;not even the  contemporary trends and sacred international rules of market economy –  the free flow of goods and capital – are being respected&#8221;</p>
<p>According  to the data from the Croatian National Bank, the Croatian companies  invested in $641.7mn by the end of last year in Serbia, making Serbia  the second largest destination for the Croatian foreign investments. The  bilateral trade between both sides has increased manifold from $40mn in  2000 to $1bn in 2009. In the past seven years the trade has gone  against Serbia registering a trade deficit of $716.6mn, and Serbia is  one of the rare European countries with which Croatia has trade surplus.</p>
<p>It  should be noted that, in a recent conference, Economy Ministry State  Secretary Nebojsa Ciric admitted that only one Serbian investment was  able to succeed in Croatia, when the Swisslion Takovo bought the  Croatian Euro Food Market but otherwise most efforts bombed. It is yet  to be seen whether the last month’s accord between both nations to  remove political bottlenecks and simplifying business processes would  translate into equilibrized economic co-operation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was always a mystery why most military powers constantly attempted to  occupy often portrayed derelict Afghanistan, but with the latest  discovery of the country being seated over more than $1tn precious  mineral deposits lays it to rest instantly. According to The New York  Times, the vast scale of Afghanistan&#8217;s mineral wealth was discovered by a  small team of Pentagon officials and American geologists.</p>
<p>Interestingly,  an internal Pentagon memo, states that Afghanistan could become the  “Saudi Arabia of lithium,” a key raw material in the manufacture of  batteries for laptops and mobile phones. It also reports that the  country is home to previously unknown deposits — including huge veins of  iron, copper, cobalt, gold and large deposits of niobium, a soft metal  used in producing superconducting steel, besides lithium.</p>
<p>The  memo compels to probe, what is Pentagon’s task in Afghanistan? Is it  mining, peace-keeping or capturing the elusive terrorists? The timing of  the announcement also induces the misgivings on the veracity of the  study as well as the US interest in the country.  Is the US trying to  stay longer in Afghanistan on this pretext to thwart the increasing  presence of the regional powers, China and India, by providing business  options to the county?</p>
<p>In November, a 30-year lease, to start  mining copper in the Aynak valley, southwest of Kabul, which holds one  of the world’s biggest untapped copper deposits, was sold to the China  Metallurgical Group for $3bn, making it the biggest foreign investment  and private business venture in Afghanistan’s history. Likewise,  post-Taliban, India is also heavily involved in the re-construction and  development of Afghanistan’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>The retrospective  chronicling of the events on the recent discovery compel to call for  more queries. Why Russia did not show much interest in Afghanistan  despite having the cognizance of country’s rare mineral wealth?</p>
<p>According  to the study, while leaving Afghanistan in 1989 after nearly a  decade-old occupation the Soviets left behind a horde of old charts and  data hinting on the massive mineral deposits in the country.  Incidentally, it says, it was with these data, the US Geological Survey  began a series of aerial surveys of Afghanistan’s mineral resources in  2006.</p>
<p>Consequently, it establishes a fact that the US entered  Afghanistan with prior knowledge of potential mineral wealth in the  country.  If there is truth in the find, then the Afghanistan’s new  found fortune fuels the perception that any ‘offensive’ war includes an  exploration agenda for natural resources or knowledge treasure trove  behind it whenever any country initiates a war in a foreign land,  especially a far-off one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Turkish government through various trade programs is ensuring that  its economy will grow by more than 12 percent in the coming quarters.  The one such program is the &#8220;Turkey-World Trade Bridge 2010 (TWTB) meet&#8221;  conducted by the Confederation of Businessmen and Industrialists of  Turkey (TUSKON), a Turkish business organization.</p>
<p>Last week,  Mehmet Simsek, Finance Minister of Turkey told that his country&#8217;s GDP  would grow 12 percent in the first quarter of 2010. He had claimed that  the economy was recovering quickly from the backlash of the global  meltdown in view of country&#8217;s several internal crisis management  programs.</p>
<p>The 2nd TWTB meet, which is expected to become a venue  for 7bn of trade deals, is held between 14th and 20th June. According to  sources, the meet has been able to attract nearly 2,200 businessmen  from 135 countries and 1,200 Turkish traders as well. About 1,600  translators are interpreting the forums into 38 languages, and the  participants would form delegations to visit 62 provinces of Turkey.</p>
<p>The  primary objective of the meet would be to include and optimize small  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) of Turkey to tide over the  challenges from the monopolistic-oriented economies. Moreover, Turkey  has no intention to endlessly wait for the EU membership to shape its  economy to usher in growth particularly at a time when Europe is facing a  volatile economic climate.</p>
<p>Through the TUSKON, a confederation  with a strong base in Turkey and abroad, the country will be assisting  entrepreneurs to overcome the language barrier by providing language  courses, and in some cases even translations. The Turkish business  confederation along with its affiliations across the world would be  working together by simplifying and expediting business processes for  country&#8217;s SMEs to make the export engine move forward rapidly.</p>
<p>The  TUSKON has sister organizations in 135 countries across the world, and  these institutions are set up by the Turkish entrepreneurs and  volunteers to integrate its members to the international business  environment. The Indo-Turkish Business Association, Thai-Turkish  Business Association, South Africa Turkish Business Association and the  Turkish and Cameroon Business Association are some of the business  organizations affiliated to the parent confederation.</p>
<p>Turkey as  an emerging export-oriented economy is paying vital importance for the  TWTB meet as its trading history indicates those Turkish international  business entities monetized significantly better than the domestic ones.  A number of government agencies and companies including the Foreign  Ministry, the Turkish Exporters Assembly (TIM), Turkish Airlines (THY)  and Bank Asya are joining force with the TUSKON to make the meet  successful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cambodia&#8217;s World Bank country manager Qimiao Fan on Tuesday said that  Cambodia’s financial and banking regulations have assisted the country  to sustain during the tumultuous times of global economic uncertainties.  While addressing the workshop on corporate governance, the World Bank  official said the success of Cambodia&#8217;s finance industry was proof that  improving corporate governance worked.</p>
<p>Qimiao apprised Cambodia&#8217;s  financial and banking methodology has particularly helped many of  Cambodia&#8217;s commercial banks and micro-finance institutions to raise  their standards of corporate governance, which eventually got rewarded  with greater investments. Likewise, Chea Chanto, governor of the  National Bank of Cambodia opined the recent bad experience of the world  financial crisis taught Cambodia the hard way about how the failure of  bank and financial system could impact livelihoods.</p>
<p>Chanto also  told that Cambodia has learned a lot from the Asian financial crisis,  and the National Bank of Cambodia has taken a series of measures to  better supervise and regulate the banking and financial system in the  country. Banks have an overwhelmingly dominant position in the country&#8217;s  financial system, representing more than 90 percent and are extremely  important engines of economic growth, he added.</p>
<p>In contrast, it  should be recalled that Qimiao had said in the recently concluded  Cambodia Development Cooperation Forum (CDCF) &#8220;transparency and  accountability in the management of public finances and natural  resources&#8221; were critical issues. This reference was in line with the  international watchdog organization, Global Witness, which slammed  donors last week for continuing to hand over huge sums of aid money,  despite evidence of widespread corruption and mismanagement of public  funds. Overseas donors continued to pledge financial support on the  controversial Land Management and Administration Project, or LMAP that  supposed to have rendered many homeless.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Organization of American States (OAS) in its 40th General Assembly in Lima is understood to have taken into consideration the recommendations by Transparency International (TI) to improve transparency and accountability in the region. The meet which is attended by representatives from the 33 member states is inaugurated by President of Peru Alan Garcia and the OAS General Secretary José Miguel Insulza.</p>
<p>The TI earlier had presented series of detailed recommendations to curb humanitarian issues including corruption and social asymmetries. In its recent press release it had appealed the OAS member states to urgently implement anti-corruption laws to ensure peace, security and sustainable development of the region.</p>
<p>According to Transparency International (TI), the anti-corruption organisation, despite the OAS being the first regional organization to adopt a convention against corruption in 1996, TI monitoring reports show there are serious gaps in its implementation. Although Insulza and other participants were able to identify the issues, it is not sure how the General Assembly – &#8220;Peace, Security and Cooperation&#8221; would translate them into meaningful action.</p>
<p>The Secretary General Insulza acknowledged &#8220;in Latin America there are too many poor, and we have important levels of inequality; but most Afro-descendants are poor, most indigenous citizens are poor, an important number of households headed by women are poor, and 80 percent of the disabled are poor. Therefore, poverty and inequality in our region have colour, gender and condition. It&#8217;s a reality. That is why we place such strong emphasis on the relationship between discrimination and human rights and also between discrimination and socio-economic problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Latin America and the Caribbean have the highest income inequality worldwide, with five of the ten most unequal countries in the world located in the region. The two-day meet is believed to have reached an agreement on broad-based involvement from private business entities along with governments to promote democracy, social equality and responsibility, and the fight against crime.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent UN report, the World Oceans Day June 8 designated  and celebrated by the UN since last year would be a fishless one in 2050  if the fishing industry failed to restructure itself. The United  Nations Environment Program report says earnest streamlining of fishing  industry is required to protect the marine life before the oceans are  completely disembowelled.</p>
<p>The report recommends reducing the  number of large industrial fishing vessels and redirecting  counter-productive subsidies. It identifies human activities has dire  effect on the world&#8217;s oceans and seas.</p>
<p>The vulnerable marine  ecosystems, such as corals, and important fisheries are being damaged by  over-exploitation, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing,  destructive fishing practices, invasive alien species and marine  pollution, especially from land-based sources.  Besides, increased sea  temperatures, sea-level rise and ocean acidification caused by climate  change also pose a greater threat to marine life which will eventually  impact the lives of coastal and island communities and economies.</p>
<p>It  is estimated that 11 to 26mn tons of fish or one-fifth of the global  reported catch annually fall under the category of illegal, unreported  and unregulated fishing. Similarly, only about 25 percent of commercial  stocks are in a healthy or even reasonably healthy state. Some 30  percent of fish stocks are considered collapsed and 90 percent of large  predatory fish like the blue fin tuna, so prized by sushi aficionados  have almost disappeared since the middle of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Nonetheless,  the five-day conference on fish conservation opened at the UN  Headquarters in New York on Monday gives hope on taking stern measures  to contain all kinds of man-made oceanic hazards. The review is held  every four years to address the declining numbers of fish stocks under  the UN agreement, which took effect from 2001.</p>
<p>The conference is  reviewing implementation of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement that  establishes a legal regime for long-term conservation and sustainable  use of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. It will provide an  opportunity for countries to consider new measures to tighten  implementation of the legal regime.</p>
<p>The day one of the conference  witnessed the UN Ambassador for the tiny Pacific nation of Palau,  Stuart Beck, condemning the killing of 73mn sharks a year, for shark fin  soup alone. &#8220;The slaughter of sharks for their fins to make soup is as  needless and cruel as the killing of elephants for their tusks to make  ornaments,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sharks are susceptible to overfishing  because of their low fertility rates and long life spans. But shark  fishing has boomed since the 1980s triggered by demand from China and  other nations for shark fin soup, a prized symbol of wealth.</p>
<p>The  global seafood consumption has doubled over the past 40 years with many  switching to seafood diet as it was found healthier than other meat  products. With the UN estimation of about 20mn boats with  fishing capacity of 1.8 to 2.8 times larger than the oceans can  sustainably support, the industry leaders as well as governments may  have to make grave compromises on ocean management to see a sustainable  ocean in the coming decades. The UN lists the top 10 nations with the  biggest fisheries hauls as China, Peru, the US, Indonesia, Japan, Chile,  India, Russia, Thailand and the Philippines.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Africa (SA) continues to reel under the &#8216;strike&#8217; bogey with  transport strike nearing end while others surfacing.  A likely strike by  half of the workers at state-owned power utility Eskom and another by  civil servants, including nurses, police and teachers, is looming large  at SA, the first African country to host the soccer World Cup.</p>
<p>SA&#8217;s  present crisis besides damaging trade with Europe and Asia, it also  corroborates the criticism by some European countries in regards to the  preparedness of the country to host such a mega event like the World Cup  come June and July. The SA Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and  Forestry Tina Joemat-Pettersson told reporters losses to the industries  under her ministry are estimated over 1bn rand ($127mn).</p>
<p>The  strike, well over a fortnight has already brought the exim trade of the  country to a standstill inflicting potential losses to the job market  and international trade contracts. Items like metals, cars, fruits and  wine to Europe and Asia, as well as imports of automotive parts and fuel  supplies is reported to have affected. FIFA, the football governing  body has informed imports of some equipment for the event has also been  impacted.</p>
<p>Though it was predicted before the strike the coal and  iron ore exports and fuel supplies could be stalled, stocks and supply  process as so far avoided such a situation. Likewise, the domestic power  supplies also have not been affected much by the strike since coal for  the power plants is largely supplied through conveyor belts directly  from the mines.</p>
<p>The workers of the SA logistics group Transnet  which has about 54000 trade union members began strike demanding 15  percent pay hike despite the group conceding 11 percent. Although over  60 percent have returned to work since Monday, the smaller South African  Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) has decided to go ahead  with its demand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Economic Forum&#8217;s Positive Infrastructure Report (PIR) finds that world faces a global infrastructure deficit of US$2 trillion per year over the next 20 years. The report analyses the four largest infrastructure markets – Latin America, China, India and the US, and studies how to best deploy public funds made available through global fiscal stimuli packages to further the cause of infrastructure development.</p>
<p>The report has clarified that though the term &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; could denote a wide range of facilities and systems including economic and financial infrastructure, social infrastructure and physical infrastructure, the study has centred on physical infrastructure. As per the report, the projections for the future infrastructural development have been drawn from a study by the consulting firm, Booz Allen Hamilton.</p>
<p>In a 2007 report, Booz Allen Hamilton has estimated that investment needed to &#8220;modernize obsolescent systems and meet expanding demand&#8221; for infrastructure worldwide between 2005 and 2030 was at about US$ 41 trillion. It said the North American (the US and the Canadian) share of the infrastructure needs alone would be around US$ 6.5 trillion through 2030.</p>
<p>While the PIR finds both involvement by public sector as in the case of China and a broad-based public private partnership (PPP) seen in India has country-specific successful models in the speedy development of infrastructural projects. The report highlights the Eleventh Five Year Plan for Energy development by the National Development and Reform Commission of the People&#8217;s Republic of China as an example of one such plan which sets specific goals for the development of energy infrastructure in China. The PPP-based National Highway Development Programme of India which aims to deliver about 55,000 kilometres of highways is cited as one good example with a clearly well-defined role for the private sector.</p>
<p>The Positive Infrastructure Initiative was launched in 2009 in response to a clear mandate provided to the Forum at the Annual Meeting 2009 in Davos by the CEOs of the leading infrastructural organizations to ensure that the massive fiscal spending on infrastructure not only generates the employment to restart the global economy but also creates infrastructure assets that foster long-term economic competitiveness, and are environmentally and socially sustainable.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) is an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging leaders in partnerships to shape global, regional and industry agendas. The official website of the WEF in its latest press release has made available details about the report.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week China has announced that it would accept public bidding for national oil reserve projects, indicating that the government is planning private participation in energy domain to cut state&#8217;s sole responsibility of generating energy to feed the growing demands. Sources say that the state is expected to even encourage private investments in wind, solar, biomass and other clean energy, including permissible areas of nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s State Council on its last Thursday&#8217;s release said the government encouraged private investment in domestic oil and gas exploration and crude oil, natural gas, refined oil storage and transportation and pipeline transportation facilities and networks. China’s strategy to bring private players to the energy sector in a big way is regarded as an attempt to support its economy that is projected to grow more than 10 percent, eventually increasing energy needs.</p>
<p>Zhao Youshan, head of the Commercial Petroleum Flow Committee of China, opined the involvement of private oil enterprises in the national strategic reserve of oil could relieve the pressure of oil exploration and production to some extent. Currently, all prospective domestic oil and gas blocks are owned by the state. The new oil and gas directive is likely to allow private enterprises to have significant stake in domestic oil and gas exploration as well as production.</p>
<p>According to Beijing Times, the enterprises bidding for the project should meet certain criteria, such as the volume of a single oil storage tank should be no less than 10,000 cubic meters. Though the reserve capacities of private enterprises are comparatively small, the private players seemed to be eager to join the national oil reserves with state support including finance, infrastructure and easily adaptable laws.</p>
<p>At present, the private enterprises involved in the supply of crude oil is very limited since they are stipulated to import 2,530 tons of crude oil per annum or about the daily imports 500,000 barrels. However, the private participation in oil and gas sector comes at a time when the country plans to augment the use of non-fossil fuels from the current 8.5 percent to 15 percent by this year end.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between India and Israel, proposed by the latter about four years ago, has all the trappings for an early completion as both sides find the future partner with complementary trade openings. The upcoming visit by a high-level delegation from Israel to New Delhi later this month is likely to give clarity on how the bilateral trade between both countries will pan out in the coming years.</p>
<p>India would be largely interested in absorbing Israel&#8217;s technological prowess in areas such as bio-tech, nano-technology, healthcare, security services, water management and agriculture. On the other hand, Israel will focus on the India’s manufacturing potential to overcome its limitations on this front.</p>
<p>Although there are equal trade and utility potential for both countries, the tariff differences remained a roadblock for the smooth transition of trade talks ever since they began. India&#8217;s tariffs are on the higher end, and will have to make steep reductions to accommodate Israel&#8217;s trading needs. However, given the smaller size of Israel&#8217;s manufacturing industry, India does not have to worry about any massive influx of goods if it compromised on tariffs.</p>
<p>Speaking to Business Line, Eli Belotserkovsky, Deputy Chief Mission, Embassy of Israel, said that there are very few issues that need to be sorted out to finalise a FTA between the two nations. He opined that the two-way trade was evenly matched at about $2bn, and projected to grow up to $6bn once the FTA was signed.</p>
<p>Belotserkovsky admitted that they were not good at mass production or heavy equipment, where India could play a big role. He also said that the textile trade was another area which had immense potential between the two nations.</p>
<p>The Indo-Israeli FTA is expected to promote investment opportunities for both governments as well as private enterprises. Among goods and services, both countries&#8217; major area of focus would be agriculture as it has been in the past few years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is now apparent in the light of various studies conducted by both the UN agencies and other independent bodies that globalization has eluded its goals by not translating it into targeted benefits. Instead of creating an all-inclusive socio-economic development across communities, it has been found that while very few prospered majority devolved.</p>
<p>The world body should lay emphasis on reducing the growing divide between the rich and the poor rather than pushing for trade to please some of the business powerhouses. If increasing world trade through global action means prosperity for all, the WTO has to address problems of the workforces that comprise of about 70 percent excluding self employed involved directly or indirectly in global trade.</p>
<p>It has to press for regulations which will bring in all workforces under one umbrella of organized sector as majority, particularly in developing countries are forced to work incognito. The workers of unorganized sector are deprived of employment protection such as paid leave, sick leave, healthcare and other perks; and are almost enslaved by their employers.</p>
<p>Similarly, even workers of organized sector are exploited by overloading with work schedules that may go up to 20hrs per day without any rest or extra allowance. Especially the workforces from countries without minimum hourly wages have been largely put to this hardship by calibrating it as a day’s work.</p>
<p>At a glance, it may seem like how on earth the strengthening of organized sector of workforce will improve the living standards of the poor and marginalized workers without developing other key areas such as free right to education, healthcare and other civic amenities. But by elevating the dignity of workers by providing reasonable earnings for what they work is likely to boost their confidence, and thereby prod themselves to meet all immediate needs without any administrative influence.</p>
<p>As far as trade is concerned, the atrocities perpetrated on workforces should also be given equal care like that of other aspects of trade agreements to avoid social unrests stemming from socio-economic asymmetries. The absence of minimum wages for workers or potentially running unorganized workforces, perhaps even with the backing of governments, should be given serious re-look as it is implied in individual trade deals as grievous human rights violations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A workshop on &#8216;green architecture and eco-tourism&#8217; will be held in Oman between 15 May and 17 May after becoming one of the many casualties to Iceland&#8217;s volcanic ashes which disrupted air-travel last month. The highly anticipated event to be attended by industry experts and technologists from France and Oman, the hosting country was originally scheduled to be held on 24 April 2010.</p>
<p>The Sultanate of Oman is conducting this workshop to enhance its interest and scientific advancement in the fields of architecture control, eco-tourism and environment protection. In the past few decades, Oman has been able to leapfrog various eco-friendly projects including renewable energy, management of waste, water resources and anti-pollution drive on marine world.</p>
<p>The study meet which is jointly organized by Ministry of Heritage and Culture and French Embassy is expected to promote sustainable development programs with emphasis on green architecture and eco-tourism. Oman industry heads would be primarily interested in technology transfer and other inputs from France to take their green industry to the next level of development.</p>
<p>French Ambassador to the Sultanate Malika Berak is of the opinion that the three-day event will prove to be an opportunity to expand bilateral ties as 10 leading architecture agencies with good number of experts from France have agreed to take part in the workshop. The event will target French and Omani architects, researchers, institutional representatives and officials in charge of sustainable development affairs to put accent on an eco-friendly comprehensive plan for all future developments in possible sectors.</p>
<p>According to sources, Jean Gautier, Director of Architecture at French Ministry of Culture and Communication, will give a presentation on the urban planning project &#8216;Grand Paris&#8217;. Besides, the Muscat municipality projects are also likely to be featured at the event to draw expert feedback.</p>
