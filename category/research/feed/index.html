				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was always a mystery why most military powers constantly attempted to  occupy often portrayed derelict Afghanistan, but with the latest  discovery of the country being seated over more than $1tn precious  mineral deposits lays it to rest instantly. According to The New York  Times, the vast scale of Afghanistan&#8217;s mineral wealth was discovered by a  small team of Pentagon officials and American geologists.</p>
<p>Interestingly,  an internal Pentagon memo, states that Afghanistan could become the  “Saudi Arabia of lithium,” a key raw material in the manufacture of  batteries for laptops and mobile phones. It also reports that the  country is home to previously unknown deposits — including huge veins of  iron, copper, cobalt, gold and large deposits of niobium, a soft metal  used in producing superconducting steel, besides lithium.</p>
<p>The  memo compels to probe, what is Pentagon’s task in Afghanistan? Is it  mining, peace-keeping or capturing the elusive terrorists? The timing of  the announcement also induces the misgivings on the veracity of the  study as well as the US interest in the country.  Is the US trying to  stay longer in Afghanistan on this pretext to thwart the increasing  presence of the regional powers, China and India, by providing business  options to the county?</p>
<p>In November, a 30-year lease, to start  mining copper in the Aynak valley, southwest of Kabul, which holds one  of the world’s biggest untapped copper deposits, was sold to the China  Metallurgical Group for $3bn, making it the biggest foreign investment  and private business venture in Afghanistan’s history. Likewise,  post-Taliban, India is also heavily involved in the re-construction and  development of Afghanistan’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>The retrospective  chronicling of the events on the recent discovery compel to call for  more queries. Why Russia did not show much interest in Afghanistan  despite having the cognizance of country’s rare mineral wealth?</p>
<p>According  to the study, while leaving Afghanistan in 1989 after nearly a  decade-old occupation the Soviets left behind a horde of old charts and  data hinting on the massive mineral deposits in the country.  Incidentally, it says, it was with these data, the US Geological Survey  began a series of aerial surveys of Afghanistan’s mineral resources in  2006.</p>
<p>Consequently, it establishes a fact that the US entered  Afghanistan with prior knowledge of potential mineral wealth in the  country.  If there is truth in the find, then the Afghanistan’s new  found fortune fuels the perception that any ‘offensive’ war includes an  exploration agenda for natural resources or knowledge treasure trove  behind it whenever any country initiates a war in a foreign land,  especially a far-off one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Ugandan scientific team is believed to have discovered an eco-friendly  method to eradicate mosquitoes. The team headed by Prof. Jasper Okeng  of the Pharmacology department of Makerere University is planning to use  insect-eating plants to contain mosquito menace to his country and  across Africa.</p>
<p>The disease-spreading ability of mosquitoes has  been constantly a threat to majority of developing countries as they  inflicted great productivity losses to these economies by hamstringing  communities with illnesses such as malaria, dengue, etc. These vectors  have taken the lives of largest number of people in the recorded human  history by spreading diseases more than any other natural calamities or  illnesses.</p>
<p>One of the latest 78 grants from the Bill and Melinda  Gates Foundation to support innovations in global health in 18 countries  towards Okeng’s effort has to be seen as an endorsement for the  continuance and efficacy of the plant research. The professor, who is  assisted by his colleagues Dr. James Kalema and Dr. Mary Namaganda, has  received a grant of $100,000 from the foundation to help the Ugandans to  grow these plants in their yards to keep mosquitoes and related  diseases at bay.</p>
<p>Okeng apprised that malaria was the biggest  killer and contributor of poverty in Africa and Uganda. &#8220;When people are  sick, they are unable to do productive work. They spend all their money  in treating malaria. Our target is to reduce poverty as well as  increase incomes,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>The professor claimed the idea  was the first of its kind in Uganda and the world as well. He described  that he acquired the knowledge of insect-eating mosquitoes in the 1960s  as a student interested in animal and plant biology.</p>
<p>He revisited  the idea when there was opposition to the nationwide spraying of  households with DDT, an insecticide toxic to animals and humans, to  control malaria. &#8220;We want people to have choices and shift from using  insecticides,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The plants are said to be very effective  in killing any flying insects like house flies, moths, aphids or  mosquitoes, and initial studies show bees are not been ensnared.   However, the team has informed that the plants will be promoted only  after a conclusive study on the effect of these on the bees. This is the  first time the plants will be cultivated and utilised in disease  control though people knew about these insect-eating plants existed in  Africa long ago.</p>
