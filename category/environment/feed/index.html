				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An initiative to make use of old rubber trees by a Canadian renewable  energy firm in Liberia is reaping rich dividends to the country’s  economy. The project is reported to have helped the farmers to get  cleared of the old trees and re-planted at no cost with guarantee of  money for the tree trunks.</p>
<p>Buchanan Renewables Power (BRP) began  commercial operations in Liberia two years ago with a complete  rejuvenation package for the non-producing rubber tree estates. The deal  for the farmers includes $2 per tonne of tree trunks, free of cost  re-plantation and for self-use or sale tree remnants which do not go  into the production of wood chips.</p>
<p>Liberia is estimated to have  more than 600,000ha of overgrown and moribund rubber farms. The new  model of rubber re-plantation rids of farmers’ laborious task of  re-claiming their estates by cutting down trees and re-planting them  spending money without revenues for a long period. After planting, the  trees take nearly seven years to start producing rubber.</p>
<p>Usually  rubber trees need to be replaced once they are over 25 years old, and  most of them in Liberia are between 30 and 60 years old. While helping  farmers, the new project will also provide electricity to communities in  the vicinity as well as has opened up exports to the woodchip markets  of Europe.</p>
<p>BRP uses massive diggers to uproot trees and a giant  mincer to produce rubber wood chips out of the trunks. The company has  exported 45,000MT of chips last year with contracts of about 90,000MT  for this year; and plans to clear 10,000ha annually.</p>
<p>The Buchanan  claims that it has the capacity to produce 400,000 tonnes of woodchips  per annum. Besides, on many farms, it has been able to plant two trees  for every one that has been harvested.</p>
<p>For Liberia it means that  many of its citizens will be re-injected to the market with jobs and  businesses, a dire need of the country that promises opportunities and  improved living standards after the end of seven years of civil war. BRP  says its vision is to achieve success in Liberia and repeat this model  in other countries in Africa and, to the extent possible, worldwide.</p>
<p>The  firm which emphasizes on cheap, environment-friendly and sustainable  energy production with a social commitment to Liberia is putting back  some of its revenues for power generation using the locally sourced wood  chips. However, the proposed 35MW power generation plant at Monrovia  which is supposed to provide electricity for half the price has not been  installed yet even two years after its approval.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent UN report, the World Oceans Day June 8 designated  and celebrated by the UN since last year would be a fishless one in 2050  if the fishing industry failed to restructure itself. The United  Nations Environment Program report says earnest streamlining of fishing  industry is required to protect the marine life before the oceans are  completely disembowelled.</p>
<p>The report recommends reducing the  number of large industrial fishing vessels and redirecting  counter-productive subsidies. It identifies human activities has dire  effect on the world&#8217;s oceans and seas.</p>
<p>The vulnerable marine  ecosystems, such as corals, and important fisheries are being damaged by  over-exploitation, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing,  destructive fishing practices, invasive alien species and marine  pollution, especially from land-based sources.  Besides, increased sea  temperatures, sea-level rise and ocean acidification caused by climate  change also pose a greater threat to marine life which will eventually  impact the lives of coastal and island communities and economies.</p>
<p>It  is estimated that 11 to 26mn tons of fish or one-fifth of the global  reported catch annually fall under the category of illegal, unreported  and unregulated fishing. Similarly, only about 25 percent of commercial  stocks are in a healthy or even reasonably healthy state. Some 30  percent of fish stocks are considered collapsed and 90 percent of large  predatory fish like the blue fin tuna, so prized by sushi aficionados  have almost disappeared since the middle of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Nonetheless,  the five-day conference on fish conservation opened at the UN  Headquarters in New York on Monday gives hope on taking stern measures  to contain all kinds of man-made oceanic hazards. The review is held  every four years to address the declining numbers of fish stocks under  the UN agreement, which took effect from 2001.</p>
<p>The conference is  reviewing implementation of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement that  establishes a legal regime for long-term conservation and sustainable  use of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. It will provide an  opportunity for countries to consider new measures to tighten  implementation of the legal regime.</p>
<p>The day one of the conference  witnessed the UN Ambassador for the tiny Pacific nation of Palau,  Stuart Beck, condemning the killing of 73mn sharks a year, for shark fin  soup alone. &#8220;The slaughter of sharks for their fins to make soup is as  needless and cruel as the killing of elephants for their tusks to make  ornaments,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sharks are susceptible to overfishing  because of their low fertility rates and long life spans. But shark  fishing has boomed since the 1980s triggered by demand from China and  other nations for shark fin soup, a prized symbol of wealth.</p>
<p>The  global seafood consumption has doubled over the past 40 years with many  switching to seafood diet as it was found healthier than other meat  products. With the UN estimation of about 20mn boats with  fishing capacity of 1.8 to 2.8 times larger than the oceans can  sustainably support, the industry leaders as well as governments may  have to make grave compromises on ocean management to see a sustainable  ocean in the coming decades. The UN lists the top 10 nations with the  biggest fisheries hauls as China, Peru, the US, Indonesia, Japan, Chile,  India, Russia, Thailand and the Philippines.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the US, companies and communities alike are fashioning the new wave of energy production by converting cooking oil waste to bio-diesel not just for greening but also for profits and revenue generation. The new craze must be regarded as the realization of a country, with oil reserves and production declining dramatically, to counter the ill effects on the environment from burning hydro-carbons and likely oil price rise that may come along with global economic uptick.</p>
<p>The US consumes nearly a quarter of the world&#8217;s oil production but just produces about 10 percent. It buys around $400bn worth of foreign oil or about the same as last year&#8217;s balance of payments deficit with its trading partners.</p>
<p>One of the companies that has established itself in used cooking oil energy domain is Minnesota-based Restaurant Technologies (RTI), the leading provider of bulk cooking oil management services to the restaurant industry. RTI has generated $240mn revenue by collecting used cooking oil, and more than 100mn gallons of used oil have been sold to biodiesel manufacturers, animal feed and other buyers.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community has recently celebrated its first anniversary of producing bio-diesel from waste soybean oil used in frying chicken, French fries and other foods. The bio-diesel is used to fuel shuttle buses that transport guests and employees among properties around the community. The success of the tribal community on implementing the bio-diesel program indicates that it made economic and environmental sense virtually practical even for small communities to engage in such initiatives.</p>
<p>The Dakota community extracts bio-diesel by pumping 100 gallons into the BioPro 380 processor at a time. Twenty gallons of methanol (wood alcohol) and small amounts of potassium chloride and sulphuric acid are added to the machine with minimal usage of vinegar late in the process. About 48 hours later, around 95 gallons of biodiesel and 25 gallons of glycerine are produced.</p>
<p>Last week, East Ridge, Tennessee has decided to utilize a self-produced new biodiesel blend to fuel its city operations fleet. It is estimated that this clean alternative to conventional fuel not only would make the air cleaner in East Ridge but also expected to provide revenue, eventually helped to lower taxes.</p>
<p>As per the program, the residents may pick up or drop designated or non-designated collection containers at any East Ridge Swap Center. These containers, once full with cooled used cooking oil—may be exchanged for an empty one. By switching to a biodiesel blend, the city of East Ridge is expected reduce its operating costs on civic amenities such as garbage collection, mowing, roadway maintenance, fire/rescue and street sweeping.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A workshop on &#8216;green architecture and eco-tourism&#8217; will be held in Oman between 15 May and 17 May after becoming one of the many casualties to Iceland&#8217;s volcanic ashes which disrupted air-travel last month. The highly anticipated event to be attended by industry experts and technologists from France and Oman, the hosting country was originally scheduled to be held on 24 April 2010.</p>
<p>The Sultanate of Oman is conducting this workshop to enhance its interest and scientific advancement in the fields of architecture control, eco-tourism and environment protection. In the past few decades, Oman has been able to leapfrog various eco-friendly projects including renewable energy, management of waste, water resources and anti-pollution drive on marine world.</p>
<p>The study meet which is jointly organized by Ministry of Heritage and Culture and French Embassy is expected to promote sustainable development programs with emphasis on green architecture and eco-tourism. Oman industry heads would be primarily interested in technology transfer and other inputs from France to take their green industry to the next level of development.</p>
<p>French Ambassador to the Sultanate Malika Berak is of the opinion that the three-day event will prove to be an opportunity to expand bilateral ties as 10 leading architecture agencies with good number of experts from France have agreed to take part in the workshop. The event will target French and Omani architects, researchers, institutional representatives and officials in charge of sustainable development affairs to put accent on an eco-friendly comprehensive plan for all future developments in possible sectors.</p>
<p>According to sources, Jean Gautier, Director of Architecture at French Ministry of Culture and Communication, will give a presentation on the urban planning project &#8216;Grand Paris&#8217;. Besides, the Muscat municipality projects are also likely to be featured at the event to draw expert feedback.</p>
